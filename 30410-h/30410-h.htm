<h2><a name="div1_7" href="#div1Ref_7">TRANSLATOR&#39;S PREFACE.</a></h2>
<hr class="W20">
<p class="normal">The Translator avails himself of his privilege of offering a few
prefatory words, chiefly in order to express the deep obligation under which he
lies to the Rev. <span class="sc">John Laing</span>, Librarian in the New College,
Edinburgh, for the valuable assistance which he afforded to him in the translation
of this work. Any observation on the work itself or its Author would be superfluous,
if not presumptuous, considering the high position which Dr <span class="sc">Hengstenberg</span>
holds as a Biblical Scholar. High, however, as this position is, the Translator
feels confident that it will be raised by the present work, the Author&#39;s <i>latest</i>
and <i>first</i>; and not only revering Dr <span class="sc">Hengstenberg</span>
as a beloved Teacher, but being under many obligations to him for proofs of personal
kindness and friendship, the Translator sincerely rejoices in this prospect.</p>
<p class="normal">As regards the translation itself, it was the Translator&#39;s aim
to bring out fully the Author&#39;s meaning. This object, which ought to be the first
in every translation, has been kept steadily in view, and preferred to all others.
In rendering Dr <span class="sc">Hengstenberg&#39;s</span> translation of Scripture-passages,
the expressions in our Authorized Version have, as far as possible, been retained.
Wherever the division of the text in the latter differed from that of the original
text, it has been added in a parenthesis; an exception in this respect having been
made in quotations from the Psalms only, in which this difference is almost constant,
the inscriptions not being counted in our English Version, while they are in the
Hebrew Text.</p>

<h2><a name="div1_9" href="#div1Ref_9">THE AUTHOR&#39;S PREFACE.</a></h2>
<hr class="W20">
<p class="normal">The first edition of the Christology, although the impression
was unusually large, had been for years out of print. It was impossible that the
work could appear a second time in its original form. The first volume of
it&mdash;written twenty-five years ago&mdash;was a juvenile performance,
to which the Author himself had become rather a stranger; and the succeeding volumes
required references to, and comparisons with, a large number of publications which
subsequently appeared. But for the remodelling and revising which these circumstances
rendered necessary, the Author could not find leisure, because new tasks were ever
and anon presenting themselves to him; and these he felt himself, as it were, involuntarily
impelled to undertake. But now he is led to believe that he could no longer delay.
A powerful inclination urges him to comment on the Gospel of St John; but he thinks
that the right to gratify this inclination must first be purchased by him by answering
a call which proceeds from the more immediate sphere of his vocation, and which
he is the less at liberty to disregard, as manifold facts give indication that the
Christology has not yet completed its course. The Author dislikes to return to regions
which have been already visited by him. He prefers the opening up to himself of
paths which are new. It cost him therefore, at first, no little struggle to devote
himself for years to the work of mere revision and emendation; but very soon, even
here, he learned the truth of the proverb: &quot;If there be obedience in the heart,
love will soon enter.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The arrangement in the present edition differs from that which
was adopted in the former. It bears a closer resemblance to that which has been
followed in the Commentaries on the Psalms, Revelation, and the Song of Solomon.
The work opens with a discussion and commentary on the particular Messianic prophecies,
in their historical order and connection. The general investigations with which,
in the first edition, the work commenced, are, in the present edition, to appear
in the form <span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>of comprehensive treatises, at the
close. The latter have thus obtained a more solid foundation; while the objections
which might be raised against this arrangement will have force only until the completion
of the whole, which, if it please the Lord, will not be very long delayed. The reader
will then, of course, be at liberty, before he enters upon the particular portions,
to go over, cursorily in the meantime, the closing treatises,&mdash;the proper study of
which will be appropriate, however, only after he has made himself acquainted with
the particular portions of the main body of the work.</p>
<p class="normal">The matter of the two sections of the first part has been entirely
rewritten. That of the two last parts appears more as a revisal only,&mdash;so executed,
however, that not a single line has been reprinted without a renewed and careful
examination.</p>
<p class="normal">The Author shall take care that the new edition shall not exceed
the former one in size. The space intended to be occupied by the enlarged discussions,
and by the new investigations, will be gained by omissions. These, however, will
be limited to such matters as now clearly appear to be superfluous; <i>so that the
old will not retain any value when compared with the new edition.</i> The Author,
had he pursued his usual method of representation, would have curtailed many points,
particularly the history of the interpretation. But the mode of treating the subject
which he had previously adopted, is not without its advantages, and has a certain
right to be retained. The former character of the work, in so far as the avoidance
of everything properly ascetic is concerned, has been, in the present edition, also
retained.</p>
<p class="normal">Scientific Theology is at present threatened by serious dangers
in our Church. Works of an immediately practical interest more and more exclusively
occupy the noblest minds, since the problems which present themselves in this field
are indeed unfathomable. But the Lord of the Church will take care that an excellent
gift, which He has bestowed upon German Christendom especially, shall not, for any
length of time, continue to be neglected. If such were to be the case, a more general
decay would be gradually brought on; and even those interests would be injured to
which at present, with a zeal, noble indeed, but little thoughtful, solid theological
learning is sacrificed.</p>

<h3>THE</h3>
<h1><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">MESSIANIC PROPHECIES IN THE PENTATEUCH.</a></h1>
<hr class="W20">
<p class="continue">In the Messianic prophecies contained in Genesis we cannot fail
to perceive a remarkable progress in clearness and definiteness.</p>
<p class="normal">The first Messianic prediction, which was uttered immediately
after the fall of Adam, is also the most indefinite. Opposed to the awful threatening
there stands the consolatory promise, that the dominion of sin, and of the evil
arising from sin, shall not last for ever, but that the seed of the woman shall,
at some future time, overthrow their dreaded conqueror. With the exception of the
victory itself, everything is here left undetermined. We are told neither the mode
in which it is to be achieved, nor whether it shall be accomplished by some peculiarly
gifted race, or family of the progeny of the woman, or by some single individual
from among her descendants. There is nothing more than a very slight hint that the
latter will be the case.</p>
<p class="normal">After the destruction of a whole sinful world, when only Noah
with his three sons had been left, the <i>general</i> promise is, to a certain extent,
defined. Deliverance is to come from the descendants of Shem; Japhet shall become
a partaker of this deliverance; Ham is passed over in silence.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophecy becomes still more definite when the Lord begins
to prepare the way for the appearance of this deliverance, by separating from the
corrupt mass a single individual&mdash;Abraham&mdash;in order to make him the depositary of
His revelations. The Lord, moreover, according to the good pleasure of His will,
further specifies which of the descendants of Abraham, to the exclusion of all the
rest, is to inherit this dignity, with all its accompanying blessings. From among
the posterity of Shem, the Lord sets apart first the family of Abraham, then that
of <span class="pagenum">[12]</span> Isaac, and lastly that of Jacob, as the family
from which salvation is to come. Yet even these predictions, distinct though they
be when compared with those previously uttered, are still very indefinite when compared
with those subsequently given, and when seen in the light of the actual fulfilment.
Even in these, the blessing only is foretold, but not its author. It still remained
a matter of uncertainty whether salvation should be extended to all the other nations
of the earth through a single individual, or through an entire people descended
from the Patriarchs. The former is obscurely indicated; but the mode in which the
blessing was to be imparted was left in darkness.</p>
<p class="normal">This obscurity is partially removed by the last Messianic prophecy
contained in Gen. xlix. 10. After what had previously taken place, we might well
expect that the question as to which of Jacob&#39;s twelve sons should have the privilege
of becoming the source of deliverance to the whole earth, would not be left undetermined;
nor could we imagine that Jacob, when, just before his death, and with the spirit
of a prophet, he transferred to his sons the promises which had been given to his
ancestors and himself, should have passed over in silence the most important part
of them. On the contrary, by being transferred to Judah, the promise of the Messiah
acquires not only the expected limitation, but an unexpected increase of clearness
and precision. Here, for the first time, the <i>person</i> of the Messiah is brought
before us; here also the <i>nature</i> of His kingdom is more distinctly pointed
out by His being represented as the peaceful one, and the peacemaker who will unite,
under His mild sceptre, all the nations of the whole earth. Judah is, in this passage,
placed in the centre of the world&#39;s history; he shall obtain dominion, and not lose
it until it has been realized to its fullest extent by means of the <i>Shiloh</i>
descending from him, to whom all the nations of the earth shall render a willing
obedience.</p>
<p class="normal">The subject-matter of the last four books of the Pentateuch would
naturally prevent us from expecting that the Messianic prophecies should occupy
so prominent a place in them as they do in Genesis. The object contemplated in these
books is rather to prepare effectually the way for the Messiah, by laying the theocratic
institutions on a firm foundation, and by establishing the law which is intended
to produce the knowledge of sin, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>to settle
discipline, and by means of which the image of God is to be impressed on the whole
national life. If the hope of the Messiah was to be realized in a proper manner,
and to produce its legitimate effect, it was necessary that the people should first
be accustomed to this new order of life; that, for the present, their regards should
not be too much drawn away from this their proximate and immediate vocation. Yet,
even in the last four books there are not wanting allusions to Him who, as the end
of the law, was, from the very beginning, to be set before the eyes of the people.</p>
<p class="normal">In Num. xxiv. 17-19, Balaam beholds an Israelitish kingdom raised
absolutely above the kingdoms of the world, extending over the whole earth, and
all-powerful; and he sees it in the form of an <i>ideal</i> king, with reference
to Jacob&#39;s prophecy contained in Gen. xlix. 10, according to which the kingdom rising
in Judah shall find its full and final realization in the person of one king&mdash;the
Messiah.</p>
<p class="normal">We have here the future King of the Jews saluted from the midst
of the heathen world, corresponding to the salutation of the manifested one by the
wise men from the East: compare Matt. ii. 1, 2.</p>
<p class="normal">From the whole position of Moses in the economy of the revelations
of God, it is, <i>a priori</i>, scarcely conceivable that he should have contented
himself with communicating a prophecy of the Messiah uttered by a non-Israelite.
We expect that, as a prefiguration of the testimony which, in the presence of the
chief among the apostles, he bore to the Messiah after He had appeared (compare
Matt. xvii. 3), he should, on his own behalf, testify his faith in Him, and direct
the people to Him. This testimony we have in Deut. xviii. 15-19. It is natural that
Moses&#39; attestation should have reference to Christ in so far as He is his antitype.
He bears witness to Christ as the true Prophet, as the Mediator of the divine revelation&mdash;thus
enlarging the slender indications of Christ&#39;s prophetical office given in Gen. xlix.
10. A new and important feature of Messianic prophecy is here, for the first time,
brought forward; and because of this, the character of the prophecy is that of a
germ. Behind the person of the future Prophet, which is as yet <i>ideal</i>, the
<i>real</i> person of Him who is the Prophet in an absolute sense, is, in the meantime,
concealed. It is reserved for the future development <span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>of
the prophetic prediction to separate that which is here beheld as still blended
in a single picture.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Finally</i>, the doctrine of the Divine Mediator of the unseen
God, of the Angel of the Lord, or of the Logos, which forms the theological foundation
for the Christology, is already found pervading the Books of Moses.</p>
<p class="normal">After this survey, we now proceed to an exposition of the particular
passages.</p>
<hr class="W20">
<h2><a name="div2_14" href="#div2Ref_14">THE PROTEVANGELIUM.</a></h2>
<p class="normal">As the mission of Christ was rendered necessary by the fall of
man, so the first dark intimation of Him was given immediately after the fall. It
is found in the sentence of punishment which was passed upon the tempter. Gen. iii.
14, 15. A correct understanding of it, however, can be obtained only after we have
ascertained who the tempter was.</p>
<p class="normal">It is, in the first place, unquestionable that a real serpent
was engaged in the temptation; so that the opinion of those who maintain that the
serpent is only a symbolical signification of the evil spirit, cannot be admitted.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_14a" href="#ftn_14a">[1]</a></sup>
There must be unity and uniformity in the interpretation of a connected passage.
But the allegorical interpretation of the <i>whole</i> is rendered impossible by
the following considerations:&mdash;The passage stands in a book of a strictly historical
character; it is connected with what follows, where the history of the same pair
who, in this section appear as actors, is carried forward; the condition of mankind
announced to them in this passage as a punishment, actually exists; there is the
absence of every indication from which it might be inferred that the author intended
to write an allegory, and not a history; there exist various passages of the New
Testament (<i>e.g.</i>, 2 Cor. xi. 3; 1 Tim. ii. 13, 14; Rom. v. 12), in which the
context of the passage before us is referred to as a real historical fact;&mdash;and there
are the embarrassment, ambiguity, and arbitrariness shown by the allegorical interpreters
whenever they attempt to exhibit the truth intended to be conveyed; whereas perspicuity
is a characteristic essential to an allegory.&mdash;The subtlety of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span> serpent, pointed out in chap. iii. 1, is a
natural attribute of that animal; and the comparison, in this respect, of the serpent
with the other beasts, clearly indicates that a real serpent is spoken of. To such
an one the denunciation of the punishment must necessarily, in the first instance,
be referred. The last two reasons also exclude the opinion that Satan assumed merely
the semblance of a serpent.</p>
<p class="normal">The serpent itself cannot, however, have acted independently;
it can only have served as an instrument to the evil spirit. The position which
the serpent would occupy, in the event of our considering it as the self-acting,
independent seducer, would be in direct contradiction to the position assigned to
the animal creation throughout Holy Scripture&mdash;especially in the history of the creation&mdash;and
would break down the limits which, according to it, separate man and beast. By such
an assumption we should be transferred from the Israelitish territory&mdash;which is distinguished
by the most sharply defined limitations of the respective spheres of God, angels,
men, and beasts&mdash;to the heathenish, were these are all mixed up together, and where
all the distinctions disappear in the confusion. Such a fact would be altogether
isolated and without a parallel in Holy Scripture. Nor is it legitimate to adduce
the argument, that the conditions and circumstances of the paradisaic period were
different from those of subsequent times. It is indeed true, according to the statements
contained in the Mosaic account itself, that the animal world of that time was different
from that of the present; but whatever, and how great soever, this difference may
have been, it had no reference to the fundamental relation of the beasts; and hence
we cannot, from it, explain the high intellectual powers with which the serpent
appears endowed, and by the abuse of which it succeeded in seducing men. Man, as
the only being on earth created in the likeness and image of God, is, in Gen. i.,
strictly distinguished from all other living beings, and invested with the dominion
over them. Into man alone did God breathe the breath of life (ii. 7); and, according
to ii. 19, 20, man recognises the great gulf which is fixed betwixt him and the
world of beasts. This gulf would be entirely filled up, the serpent would altogether
step beyond the sphere appointed by the Creator to the world of beasts, if there
were no <i>background</i> in Gen. iii. 1-5. <i>Further</i>, The words
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span> of the serpent are an effect of wickedness:
they raise in man doubts as to the love of God, in order thereby to seduce him to
apostasy, and bring about the execution upon him of the fearful threatening, &quot;On
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; The serpent does not stand
in the truth; it speaks lies; it represents to man as the highest good, that which
in truth is the highest evil. Such language cannot proceed spontaneously from a
being, the creation of which falls within the work of the six days during which
the whole animal creation was made. For everything created within this space of
time was <i>good</i>, according to the remark constantly repeated in the history
of creation. To this we must add the nature of the curse itself, in which a higher
reference to an invisible author of the temptation shines clearly through the lower
reference to the visible one; and, further, the remark in iii. 1, &quot;Now the serpent
was more subtle,&quot; etc., evidently points to something beyond the natural subtlety
of the serpent, as the result of which the subsequent words cannot be understood,
but behind which we may discover the intimation: let him who reads, understand.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The view, that the serpent was the sole independent
agent in this transaction, is thus refuted by internal reasons. It is set aside
by the testimony of tradition also. It was an opinion universally prevalent among
the Jews, that Satan himself had been active in the temptation of the first man.
It is found in <i>Philo</i>; and in the Book of Wisdom, ii. 24, it is said, &quot;By
the envy of <i>Satan</i>, death came into the world.&quot; In the later Jewish writings,
<i>Sammael</i>, the head of the evil spirits, is called
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513; &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;</span> &quot;the old serpent,&quot; or simply
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;</span> &quot;serpent,&quot; because in the form of a serpent
he tempted Eve. (See the passage in <i>Eisenmenger&#39;s entdecktes Judenthum</i> i.
S. 822.) In the sacred books of the Persians also, the agency of Satan in the fall
of our first parents is taught. According to the <i>Zendavesta</i> (ed. by <i>Kleuker</i>,
Th. 3, S. 84, 85), the first men, Meshia and Meshianeh, were created by God in a
state of purity and goodness, and destined for happiness, on condition of humility
of heart, obedience to the requirements of the law, and purity in thoughts, words,
and actions. But they were deceived by Ahriman, &quot;this mischievous one who from the
beginning sought only to deceive, were induced to rebel against God, and forfeited
their happiness by the eating of fruits.&quot; According to the same book (Th. iii.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span> S. 62), Ahriman in the form of a serpent springs
down from heaven to earth; and another evil spirit is called (Th. ii. S. 217) the
serpent&mdash;<i>Dew.</i> (Compare <i>Rhode</i>, <i>die heilige Sage des Zendvolkes</i>,
S. 392.) These facts prove that at the time when the Persian religion received Jewish
elements (compare <i>Stuhr</i>, <i>die Religionssysteme des Orientes</i>, S. 373),
and hence, soon after the captivity, the doctrine of Satan&#39;s agency in the temptation
of our first parents was prevalent among the Jews.</p>
<p class="normal">But of decisive weight upon this point is the evidence furnished
by the New Testament. We must here above all consider the important testimony supplied
by the fact of the history of the first and second Adam being parallel (Rom. v.
12 sqq.; 1 Cor. xv. 45 sqq.),&mdash;a testimony, the weight and importance of which have,
in modern times, been again pointed out by <i>Hahn</i> in his <i>Dogmatik</i>. The
necessity of Christ&#39;s temptation by the prince of this world, in order that He,
by His firm resistance, might deprive him of his dominion over mankind, indicates
that Adam was assailed by the same tempter, and, by being overcome, laid the foundation
of that dominion.</p>
<p class="normal">Among the express verbal testimonies of the New Testament, we
must first consider the declarations of the Lord Himself; and among these the passage
John viii. 44 requires, above all, to be examined. In that passage the Lord says:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8050;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#8055;&#945;&#962;

&#959;&#8016;&#967; &#7957;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;&#903; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;. &#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#8135; &#964;&#8056; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7984;&#948;&#8055;&#969;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#903;

in the opinion, that Satan is in this passage called the murderer of men from the
beginning, with reference to the murder by Cain&mdash;an opinion lately brought forward
again by <i>Nitzsch</i>, <i>Lücke</i>, and others. This is evident from a comparison
of 1 John iii. 12, 15, and of Rev. xii. 3. (See my commentary on this passage.)
Moreover, the words in ver. 40, &quot;Ye seek to kill Me,&quot; have a more direct parallelism
in Cain&#39;s murder of his brother, than in the death which Satan brought upon our
first parents; although it is altogether wrong to maintain, as <i>Lücke</i> does,
that Satan at that time committed only a <i>spiritual</i> murder, which could not
have come under notice. Bodily death also came upon mankind through the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span> temptation. (Compare Gen. ii. 17, iii. 19;
Wisd. ii. 24; Rom. v. 12.) But when the reference to Cain&#39;s slaying his brother
is brought forward as the sole, or even as the principal one, we must absolutely
reject it. Cain&#39;s murder of his brother comes into consideration only as an effect
of the evil principle which was introduced into human nature by the first temptation;
as, indeed, it appears in the book of Genesis itself as the fruit of the poisonous
tree, the planting of which is detailed in chap. iii. The same murderous spirit
which impelled Satan to bring man under the dominion of death by the lie, &quot;Ye shall
not surely die,&quot; was busy in Cain also, and seduced him to slay his pious brother.
The following reasons forbid an exclusive reference to the deed of Cain:&mdash;1. The
murdering of man by Satan is brought into the closest connection with his <i>lie</i>.
In connection with Cain&#39;s deed, however, there was not even the appearance of falsehood;
while, in the case before us, lies, false and deceitful promises of high blessings
to be attained, and the raising of suspicions against God, were the very means by
which he seduced man, and brought him under the power of sin. The words of Jesus,
when they are understood according to their simple meaning, carry us back to an
event in the primitive times, in which murder and the spirit of falsehood went hand
in hand. 2. The co-operation of Satan in Cain&#39;s deed is not expressly mentioned
in Genesis. That there was any such we can with certainty infer, only if this event
be viewed in close connection with what Satan did against our first parents,&mdash;if,
behind the serpent, Satan be concealed. Whensoever Jesus has to deal with Jews,
He does not teach any mysterious doctrines, but makes an open appeal to the events
narrated in Scripture. 3. The words, &quot;Ye are of your father the devil,&quot; point to
the seed of the serpent spoken of in Gen. iii. 15. 4. The words, &quot;From the beginning,&quot;
direct to an event which happened at the first beginnings of mankind, and in which
our first parents took a part. Whatever this may be, the event in question must
be the first in which the devil manifested himself as the murderer of man. Now,
as by the Jews of that time the temptation of the first man, in consequence of which
death entered the world, was attributed to sin&mdash;and this appears not only from what
has been already said, but also from a passage in the <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, referred
to by <i>Tholuck</i>, in which the wicked are <span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
called &quot;The children of the old serpent which has slain Adam and all who are descended
from him&quot;&mdash;it is evident that, by &quot;the murderer of men from the beginning,&quot; Jesus
can mean only the first tempter of men. That the words, &quot;from the beginning,&quot; refer
to the fall of the first man, is also clearly shown by the parallel passages 1 John
iii. 8, and Rev. xii. 9, xx. 2. 5. Jesus says: Satan stands not in the truth, does
not move in its element, because there is no truth in him. This points to a well-known
event, in which Satan displayed his lying nature; and such is found only in the
account of man&#39;s fall. 6. Jesus calls Satan not only a liar, but, by way of emphasis,
He designates him as the father of lies. But Satan can be designated thus, only
with reference to a lie of his which is charged against him by Scripture, and which
preceded all lies on earth. Now that is the lie of which we have an account in Gen.
iii. 4, 5. The words, &quot;and the father of it,&quot; correspond with the words, &quot;from the
beginning.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Another declaration of our Lord is found in St Matthew xiii. 38:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#950;&#953;&#950;&#8049;&#957;&#953;&#8049; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</span> (<i>i.e.</i>,
<i>mali</i>, <i>masculinum</i>, according to <i>Bengel</i>), compared with ver.
39: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8001; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#967;&#952;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#8001; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8049; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#948;&#953;&#8049;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;.</span>
The children of the wicked one, or of the devil, who are spoken of in this passage,
are the seed of the serpent who is mentioned in Gen. iii. 15, and to whom allusion
is made in the words <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8001; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#945;</span> also. Less
incontrovertible is the passage in St Matthew xxiii. 33, where the Lord addressed
the Pharisees as <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8004;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#962;, &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#967;&#953;&#948;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</span>.
(Compare Matt. xii. 34, iii. 7.) <i>Olshausen</i>, in his commentary on Matt. iii.
7, gives it as his opinion that the serpent designates the <i>diabolic nature</i>.
But, according to Matt. xii. 34, the point of comparison is only the wickedness
(<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8054; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>), and it is quite sufficient
to refer it to Ps. cxl. 4, where David says of the future enemies of his dynasty
and family foreseen by him, &quot;They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders&#39;
poison is under their lips&quot; (compare also Ps. lviii. 5; Deut. xxxii. 33; Isa. lix.
5),&mdash;a passage to which special allusion is made in the words,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#8182;&#962; &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#949; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8048; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, Matt. xii. 34, and
in the connection of serpents with vipers, which would be strange when referred
to the history of the fall of the first man.</p>
<p class="normal">Let us now turn from the Lord to His disciples. Just as is done
in the account of the transaction itself, Paul, in 2 Cor. <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 20]</span> xi. 3 (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#8001; &#8004;&#966;&#953;&#962; &#917;&#8020;&#945;&#957; &#7952;&#958;&#951;&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#957;

background, and speaks of the visible one only. But that behind the serpent he beholds

the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> is explained by <i>Bengel</i>:
&quot;<i>Transformat se: Præsens, i.e., solet se transformare. Fecit id jam in Paradiso.</i>&quot;
The Apostle alludes to an event narrated in Scripture, where Satan shows himself
in this character. But such an occurrence is not found anywhere else than in Gen.
iii. 4, 5, the only passage where Satan represents himself as the friend and saviour
of men. We have here the explanation of the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#951;&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span>
in ver. 3.&mdash;In Rom. xvi. 20, the words, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8009; &#948;&#8050; &#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#968;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#931;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#8118;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#8057;&#948;&#945;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>, contain an allusion to
Gen. iii. 15, too plain to be mistaken. The Apostle recognises, in the promise of
the victory over the serpent given there, a pledge of the victory over Satan. The
words of Paul to Elymas in Acts xiii. 10, &quot;O thou child of the devil,&quot; likewise
contain a distinct reference to that which, in the history of man&#39;s fall, is written
concerning the serpent. In the charge of subtlety, mischief, and enmity to all righteousness
which he brings against him, there is an evident allusion to Genesis.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1 John iii. 8, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8009; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;&#957;,
&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#957;&#903; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7936;&#960;&#8125; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8134;&#962; &#8001; &#948;&#953;&#8049;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span>, allusion is made
to a most heinous sin committed by Satan at the first beginnings of the human race.
But of such a sin there is no account, unless Satan be concealed behind the serpent.&mdash;In
Rev. xii. 9 (comp. xx. 2), Satan is called the great dragon, and the <i>old serpent</i>;
the last of which designations refers to the passage now under consideration.</p>
<p class="normal">The agency of Satan in the fall of man has been controverted,
on the plea that, had such been in operation, it ought to have been mentioned. But
the absence of any such mention may be explained on the ground that it is not the
intention of the holy writers to give any information respecting the existence of
the devil, but rather to give an account of his <i>real</i> manifestation, to which,
afterwards, the doctrine connected itself. The judgment of the reader should not,
as it were, be <span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span> anticipated. The simple fact
is communicated to him, in order that, from it, he may form his own opinion.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Further</i>,&mdash;It has been asserted that, in the entire Old Testament,
and until the time of the Babylonian captivity, no trace of an evil spirit is to
be found, and that, hence, it cannot be conceived that his existence is here presupposed.
But this assertion may now be regarded as obsolete and without foundation. Closely
connected with the affirmation, to which allusion has just been made, is the opinion
which assigns the Book of Job to the time of the captivity, an opinion which is
now almost universally abandoned. This book must necessarily have been written before
the time of the captivity, because Jeremiah refers to it, both in his Prophecies
(<i>e.g.</i>, Jer. xx. 15 sq., which passage evidently rests on Job iii.) and in
his Lamentations. (Compare, for a fuller discussion of this subject, <i>Küper&#39;s</i>
&quot;<i>Jeremias libror. Sacrorum interpres atque Vindex</i>&quot;) The reference in Amos
iv. 3 to Job ix. 8, and several allusions occurring in the Prophecies of Isaiah
(<i>e.g.</i>, chap. xl. 2 and lxi. 7, which refer to the issue of Job&#39;s history,
which is here viewed as a prophecy of the future fate of the Church; the peculiar
use of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;</span> in xl. 2, which alludes to Job
vii. 1; chap. li. 9, which rests on Job xxvi. 13), lead us still farther back. The
assertion of those also who feel themselves compelled to acknowledge the pre-exilic
origin of the book, but who maintain, at the same time, that the Satan of this book
is not the Satan of the later books of the Old Testament, but rather a good angel
who only holds an odious office, is more and more admitted to be futile; so that
we must indeed wonder how even <i>Beck</i> (<i>Lehrwissenschaft</i> i. S. 249) could
be carried away by it, and could make the attempt to support this pretended fact
by the supposition, that the apostasy of part of the angels from God, and their
kingdom of darkness, are ever advancing and progressing. The principal evil spirit
is, in Zech. iii. 1, introduced as the adversary of the holy ones of God; and this
very name is sufficient to contradict such a supposition, for the name is descriptive
of the wickedness of the character. He who, under all circumstances, is an &quot;adversary,&quot;
must certainly carry the principle of hatred in his heart. He moves about on the
earth for the purpose of finding materials for his accusations, and grounds on which
he may raise suspicions. It is a characteristic <span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
feature, that he whose darkness does not comprehend the light, knows of no other
piety but that which has its origin in the hope of reward. It is quite evident that
it is the desire of his heart to destroy Job by sufferings. The only circumstance
which seems to give any countenance to the supposition is, that he appears in the
midst of the angels, before the throne of God. But this circumstance is deprived
of all its significancy, if the fact be kept in view&mdash;which, indeed, is most evident&mdash;that
the book is, from beginning to end, of a purely poetical character. The form of
it is easily accounted for by the intention to impress this most important thought:
that Satan stands in absolute dependence upon God; that, with all his hatred to
the children of God, he can do nothing against them, but must, on the contrary,
rather subserve the accomplishment of the thoughts of God&#39;s love regarding them.&mdash;Isaiah
likewise points to evil spirits in chap. xiii. 21, xxxiv. 14. (Compare my Comment.
on Rev. xviii. 2.)&mdash;But even in some passages of the Pentateuch itself, the doctrine
regarding Satan is brought before us. It is true that it has been erroneously supposed
to be contained in Deut. xxxii. 17 (compare on this opinion, my Comment. on Ps.
cvi. 37); but only bigotry and prejudice can refuse to admit that, under the <i>
Asael</i>, to whom, according to Lev. xvi., a goat was sent into the wilderness,
Satan is to be understood. (The arguments in support of this view will be found
in the author&#39;s &quot;<i>Egypt and the Books of Moses</i>,&quot; p. 168 ff.)<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_22a" href="#ftn_22a">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">But we must advert to two additional considerations. <i>First</i>,&mdash;To
every one who is in the least familiar with the territory <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 23]</span> of divine revelation, and who has any conception of the relation
in which the Books of Moses stand to the whole succeeding revelation, it will,
<i>a priori</i>, be inconceivable, that a doctrine which afterwards occupies so
prominent a position in the revealed books should not have already existed, in the
germ at least, in the Books of Moses. <i>Secondly</i>,&mdash;We should altogether lose
the origin and foundation of the doctrine concerning Satan, if he be removed from,
or explained away in, the history of the fall. That the first indication of this
doctrine cannot by any means be found in the Book of Job, has already been pointed
out by <i>Hofmann</i>, who remarks in the <i>Schriftbeweis</i> i. S. 378, that Satan
appears in this book as a well-known being, as much so as are the sons of God. Nor
is Lev. xvi. an appropriate place for introducing, for the first time, this doctrine
into the knowledge of the people. The doctrinal essence of the symbolical action
there prescribed is this:&mdash;that Satan, the enemy of the Congregation of God, has
no power over those who are reconciled to God; that, with their sins forgiven by
God, they may joyfully appear before, and mock and triumph over, him. The whole
ritual must have had in it something altogether strange for the Congregation of
the Lord, if they had not already known of Satan from some other source. The questions:
Who is Asael? What have we to do with him? must have forced themselves upon every
one&#39;s mind. It is not the custom of Scripture to introduce its doctrines so abruptly,
to prescribe any duty which is destitute of the solid foundation of previous instruction.</p>
<p class="normal">If thus we may consider it as proved, (1) that the serpent was
an agent in the temptation, and (2) that it served only as an instrument to Satan,
the real tempter,&mdash;then we have also thereby proved that the curse denounced against
the tempter must have a double sense. It must, in the first place, refer to the
instrument; but, in its chief import, it must bear upon the real tempter, for it
was properly he alone who had done that which merited the punishment and the curse.
Let us now, upon this principle, proceed to the interpretation of our passage.</p>
<p class="normal">It is said in ver. 14: &quot;<i>And Jehovah Elohim said unto the serpent,
Because thou hast done this, thou shalt be cursed above all cattle and above every
beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the
days of thy life.</i>&quot;&mdash;If we do not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span> look beyond
the serpent, these words have in them something incomprehensible, inasmuch as the
serpent is destitute of that responsibility which alone could justify so severe
a sentence. There is no difficulty attached to the idea that the serpent must suffer.
It shares this fate along with all the other irrational earthly creation, which
is made subject to vanity (Rom. viii. 20), and which must accompany man, for whose
sake it was created, through all the stages of his existence. But the question here
at issue is not about mere suffering, but about well-merited punishment. The serpent
is not, like the whole remaining earth, cursed for the sake of man (Gen. iii. 17),
but it is cursed because &quot;it has done this.&quot; Punishment presupposes being created
in the image of God, and, according to chap. i., such a creation is peculiar only
to man. But as soon as we assume the co-operation of an invisible author of the
temptation, by whom the serpent was animated, everything which is here threatened
against the visible instrument acquires a symbolical meaning. The degradation inflicted
upon the latter,&mdash;the announcement of the defeat which it is to sustain in the warfare
with man,&mdash;represent in a figure the fate of the real tempter only. The instrument
used by him in the temptation is at the same time the symbol of the punishment which
he is destined to endure.</p>
<p class="normal">Although it be said that the serpent should be &quot;cursed above all
cattle,&quot; etc., this does not necessarily imply that the other animals are also cursed,
any more than the words, &quot;subtle above all the beasts,&quot; imply that all other beasts
are subtle. It is certainly not always necessary that the whole existing difference
should be pointed out. The sense is simply: Thou shalt be more cursed than all cattle.
In a similar manner it is said, in the song of Deborah, concerning Jael, &quot;Blessed
above women shall Jael be,&quot; Judges v. 24; for this does not imply that all other
women are blessed, but means only that, whether they be blessed or not, Jael, at
all events, is the most blessed.</p>
<p class="normal">The <i>eating of dust</i> must not be interpreted literally, as
if the serpent were to feed upon dust; but, since it is to creep on the ground,
it cannot be but that it swallow dust along with its food. Thus we find in Ps. cii.,
in &quot;the prayer of the afflicted,&quot; ver. 10, &quot;For I have eaten ashes like bread,&quot;
used of occasional swallowing of ashes. As an expression of deepest humiliation,
the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span> licking of dust is used in Mic. vii. 17,
where it is said of the enemies of the Church, &quot;They shall lick dust like the serpent.&quot;
In Is. xlix. 23, compared with Ps. lii. 9, the licking up the dust of the feet is
likewise inflicted upon the humbled enemies. If, undoubtedly, there be, even in
these passages, a slight reference to the one before us, the allusion to it is still
plainer in Is. lxv. 25, where it is said, &quot;And dust shall be the serpent&#39;s meat.&quot;
Of the denunciation in Gen. iii. 14, 15, the eating of dust alone shall remain,
while the bruising of the heel shall come to an end. And while all other creatures
shall escape from the doom which has come upon them in consequence of the fall of
man, the serpent&mdash;the instrument used in the temptation&mdash;shall, agreeably to the words
in the sentence of punishment, &quot;All the days of thy life,&quot; remain condemned to a
perpetual abasement, thus prefiguring the fate of the real tempter, for whom there
is no share in the redemption.</p>
<p class="normal">The opinion which has been again of late defended by <i>Hofmann</i>
and <i>Baumgarten</i>, that the serpent had before the fall the same shape as after
it, only that after the fall it possesses as a punishment what before the fall was
its nature, stands plainly opposed to the context. Even <i>a priori</i>, and in
accordance with Satan&#39;s usual mode of proceeding, it is probable that he, who loves
to transform himself into an angel of light, should have chosen an attractive and
charming instrument of temptation. This view loses all that is strange in it, if
only we consider the change of the serpent, not as an isolated thing, but in connection
with the great change which, after the fall of man, affected the whole nature (comp.
Gen. i. 31, according to which the entire animal creation had, previously to the
fall, impressed upon it the image of man&#39;s innocence and peace, and the law of destruction
did not pervade it, Gen. iii. 17; Rom. viii. 20); and if only we keep in mind that,
before the fall, the whole animal world was essentially different from what it is
now, so that we cannot by any means think of forming to ourselves a distinct Image
of the serpent, as <i>Luther</i> and others have done.</p>
<p class="normal">The serpent is thus, by its disgusting form, and by the degradation
of its whole being, doomed to be the visible representative of the kingdom of darkness,
and of its head, to whom it had served as an instrument. But the words, when applied
to the head himself, give expression to the idea: &quot;extreme contempt,
the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span> shame, and abasement shall be thy
lot.&quot; Thus <i>Calmet</i> remarks on this passage: &quot;This enemy of mankind crawls,
as it were, on his belly, on account of the shame and disgrace to which he is reduced.&quot;
Satan imagined that, by means of the fall of man, he would enlarge his kingdom and
extend his power. But to the eye of God the matter appeared in a totally different
light, because, along with the fall, He beheld the redemption.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 15. &quot;<i>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed; and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise its heel.</i>&quot; In the two other passages where the word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1493;&#1507;</span> occurs (Ps. cxxxix. 11 [compare my commentary
on that passage] and Job ix. 17), it undeniably signifies: &quot;to crush,&quot; &quot;to bruise.&quot;
This signification, therefore, which is confirmed by the Chaldee Paraphrast, and
which Paul also follows in Rom. xvi. 20 (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#968;&#949;&#953;</span>,
whilst the LXX. have <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span>), must here also
be retained. It is only in appearance that, in the second passage referred to, the
signification &quot;to crush&quot; seems to be inappropriate; for there, &quot;to crush&quot; is used
in the sense of &quot;to destroy,&quot; &quot;to annihilate,&quot; just as in Jonah iv. 7, &quot;to strike&quot;
is used of the sting of an insect, because its effect is similar to that produced
by a stroke. The words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;</span> are a second accusative governed by the
verb, whereby the place of the action is more distinctly marked out. That by &quot;head&quot;
and &quot;heel&quot;&mdash;a <i>majus</i> and a <i>minus</i>&mdash;a victory of mankind over the seed
of the serpent should be signified, was seen by <i>Calvin</i>, who says, &quot;Meanwhile
we see how graciously the Lord deals even in the punishment of men, inasmuch as
He does not give the serpent power to do more than wound the heel, while to man
is given the power of wounding its head. For the words &#39;head&#39; and &#39;heel&#39; point out
only what is superior and what is inferior.&quot; That these words are by no means intended
to describe the mutual antipathy between men and serpents, is rendered evident by
the consideration, that, if such were the intention, no special punishment would
be denounced against the serpent, while, according to the context, such denunciation
is certainly designed by the writer. The words treat of the punishment of the serpent;
it is only in ver. 16 that the sentence against man is proclaimed. It is true that
the bite of a serpent is dangerous when it is applied even to the heel, for the
poison thence<!--thence 1854 ed&mdash--> penetrates the whole body; but to this
fact in natural history there is here <span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span> no allusion,
nor is the <i>biting</i> of the serpent at all the point here in question. The contrast
between head and heel is simply that which exists between the noble and less noble
parts,&mdash;those parts of which the injury is commonly curable or incurable. The objection:
&quot;The serpent creeps, man walks upright; if then an enmity exists between them, how
can it be otherwise than that man wounds its head, and that it wounds his heel?&quot;
entirely overlooks the consideration, that, according to ver. 14, it is in consequence
of the divine curse that the serpent creeps in the dust. In this degraded condition&mdash;a
condition which is not natural, but inflicted as a punishment&mdash;it is implied that
the serpent can attack man at his heel only. This plain connection between ver.
15 and 14 is evidently overlooked by those who hold the opinion, that this mutual
enmity is pernicious equally to man and serpent. The very circumstance that the
serpent is condemned to go on its belly, and to eat dust, whilst man retains that
erect walk in which the image of God is reflected, paves the way for the announcement
of the victory in ver. 16.</p>
<p class="normal">Experience bears ample witness to the truth of the divine sentence,
that there shall, in future, be enmity between the seed of the serpent and mankind,
in so far as this sentence refers to the instrument of the temptation; for abhorrence
of the serpent is natural to man. Thus <i>Calvin</i> remarks: &quot;It is in consequence
of a secret natural instinct that man abhors them; and as often as the sight of
a serpent fills us with horror, the recollection of our apostasy is renewed.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">But, in the fate of the serpent which is here announced, there
is an indication of the doom of the spiritual author of the temptation. It has been
objected that any reference to Satan is inadmissible, because the &quot;seed of the serpent&quot;
here spoken of cannot designate wicked men, who are &quot;children of the devil;&quot; for
these, too, belong to the seed of the woman, and cannot, therefore, be put in opposition
to it. But against this objection <i>Storr</i>, in his treatise, <i>de Protevangelio</i>,
remarks: &quot;We easily see that many of the seed of the woman likewise belong to the
seed of the serpent; but they have become unworthy of that name, since they apostatized
to the common enemy of their race.&quot; It is quite true that, by the seed of the woman,
her whole progeny is designated; but they who enter into communion
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span> with the hereditary enemy of the human race
are viewed as having excommunicated themselves. Compare Gen. xxi. 12, where Isaac
alone is declared to be the true descendant of Abraham, and his other sons are,
as false descendants, excluded. Moreover, not only wicked men, but also the angels
of Satan (Matt. xxv. 41; Rev. xii. 7-9), belong to the seed of the serpent.</p>
<p class="normal">The greater number of the earlier Christian interpreters were
of opinion that, by the seed of the woman, the Messiah is directly pointed at. But
to this opinion it may be objected, that it does violence to the language to understand,
by the seed of the woman, any single individual; and the more so, since we are compelled
to understand, by the seed of the serpent, a plurality of individuals, viz., the
spiritual children of Satan, the heads and members of the kingdom of darkness.
<i>Further</i>,&mdash;As far as the sentence has reference to the serpent, the human race
alone can be understood by the seed of the woman; and to this, therefore, the victory
over the invisible author of the temptation must also be adjudged. The reference
to the human race is also indicated by the connection between &quot;her seed&quot; in this
verse, and the words, &quot;Thou shalt bring forth sons,&quot; in ver. 16. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;As
the person of the Messiah does not yet distinctly appear even in the promises to
the Patriarchs, this passage cannot well be explained of a personal Messiah; inasmuch
as, by such an explanation, the progressive expansion of the Messianic prophecy
in Genesis would be destroyed.</p>
<p class="normal">If, however, by the seed of the woman we understand the entire
progeny of the woman, we obtain the following sense: &quot;It is true that thou hast
now inflicted upon the woman a severe wound, and that thou and thine associates
will continue to assail her: but, notwithstanding thine eager desire to injure,
thou shalt be able to inflict on mankind only such wounds as are curable; while,
on the contrary, the posterity of the woman shall, at some future period, vanquish
thee, and make thee feel all thy weakness.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">This interpretation is found as early as in the Targum of Jonathan,
and in that of Jerusalem, where, by the seed of the woman, are understood the Jews,
who, at the time of the Messiah, shall overcome Sammael. Thus, too, does Paul explain
it in Rom. xvi. 20, where the promise is regarded as referring to Christians as
a body. It has found, subsequently, an able defender <span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
in <i>Calvin</i><sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_29a" href="#ftn_29a">[3]</a></sup>
and, in modern times, in <i>Herder</i>.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_29b" href="#ftn_29b">[4]</a></sup>
The treatise of <i>Storr</i>, too (in the <i>Opusc.</i> ii.), is devoted to its
defence.</p>
<p class="normal">Even according to this interpretation, the passage justly bears
the name of the <i>Protevangelium</i>, which has been given to it by the Church.
It is only in general terms, indeed, that the future victory of the kingdom of light
over that of darkness is foretold, and not the person of the Redeemer who should
lead in the warfare, and bestow the strength which should be necessary for maintaining
it. Anything beyond this we are not even entitled to expect at the first beginnings
of the human race; a gradual progress is observable in the kingdom of grace, as
well as in that of nature.</p>
<p class="normal">It is certainly, however, not a matter of chance that the posterity
of the woman is not broken up into a plurality, but that, in order to designate
it, expressions in the singular (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;</span>) are chosen. This unity, which, in the
meanwhile, it is true, is only <i>ideal</i>, was chosen with regard to the person
of the Redeemer, who comprehends within Himself the whole human race. And it is
not less significant, and has certainly a deeper ground, that the victory over the
serpent is assigned to the seed of the woman, not to the posterity of Adam; and
though, indeed, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span> the circumstance that the woman
was first deceived may have been the proximate cause of it, yet it cannot be exclusively
referred to, and derived from, it. By these remarks we come still nearer to the
view of the ancient Church.</p>

	<sup class="ftnRef">[2]</sup></a> The positive reasons by which I there proved
	the reference to Satan, have not been invalidated by the objections of <i>Hofmann</i>
	in his <i>Schriftbeweis</i> i. 379. He says: As an adjective formed in a manner
	similar to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;</span> (Num. xxi. 6) must have
	an intransitive signification, it cannot mean &quot;separated,&quot; but according to
	its derivation from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1494;&#1500; = &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;</span>, it means:
	&quot;altogether gone away.&quot; But this argument has no force. The real import of the
	form of the word is gradation, and frequent repetition. Instances of a passive
	signification are given in <i>Ewald&#39;s Lehrbuch der Hebr. Sprache</i>, § 157
	c.: compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Deut. xxxii. 5. There is so much the stronger reason
	for adopting the passive signification, that in Arabic also,&mdash;which alone can
	be consulted, as the comparison with the Hebrew
	<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1494;&#1500;</span> has no sure foundation on which to

<h2><a name="div2_30" href="#div2Ref_30">THE BLESSINGS OF NOAH UPON SHEM AND JAPHETH</a></h2>
<h3>(Gen. ix. 18-27.)</h3>
<p class="normal">Ver. 20. &quot;<i>And Noah began and became an husbandman, and planted
vineyards.</i>&quot;&mdash;This does not imply that Noah was the first who began to till the
ground, and, more especially, to cultivate the vine; for Cain, too, was a tiller
of the ground, Gen. iv. 2. The sense rather is, that Noah, after the flood, again
took up this calling. Moreover, the remark has not an independent import; it serves
only to prepare the way for the communication of the subsequent account of Noah&#39;s
drunkenness. By this remark, a defence of Noah on account of his drunkenness is
entirely cut off. Against such a defence <i>Luther</i> expressed himself in very
strong terms: &quot;They,&quot; says he, &quot;who would defend the Patriarch in this, wantonly
reject the consolation which the Holy Ghost considered to be necessary to the Church&mdash;the
consolation, namely, that even the greatest saints may, at times, stumble and fall.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_30a" href="#ftn_30a">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 21. &quot;<i>And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he
was uncovered within his tent.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 22. &quot;<i>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness
of his father, and told his two brethren without.</i>&quot;&mdash;David is reproved in 2 Sam.
xii. 14, for having given occasion to the enemies of God to blaspheme. The same
reproof might justly be administered to Noah also. Ham rejoiced to find a nakedness
in him whose reproving earnestness had often been a burden to his sinful soul.
<i>Luther</i> remarks: &quot;There is no doubt <span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span> that
he (Noah) must have done much which was offensive to his proud, high-minded, and
presumptuous son.... For this reason we must not regard this deed of Ham as mere
child&#39;s play, as an action destitute of all significance; but as the result of the
bitterest hatred and resentment of Satan, by which he prepares and excites his members
against the true Church, and specially against those who are in the ministry. Let
them, therefore, give earnest heed as to whether, either in their persons or in
their offices, they give any occasion for blasphemy. We have in this history an
example of divine terrors and judgment, that we may take warning from the danger
of Ham, and not venture to be rash in judging, though we should see that a secular
or ecclesiastical authority, or even our parents, do err and fall.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 23. &quot;<i>And Shem and Japheth took the garment.</i>&quot;&mdash;<i>Luther</i>
says: &quot;Such an outward and lovely reverence they could not have shown to their father,
if they had not, inwardly and in their hearts, been rightly disposed towards God,
and had not considered their father as a high priest and king set over them by divine
appointment.&quot; The mode of expression indicates that the real impulse proceeded from
Shem, and that, as a prefiguration of what was to take place, Japheth only showed
susceptibility for the good, and a willingness to join with him. It is true that
the singular <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1495;</span> is not, by itself, decisive.
When the verb precedes, it is not absolutely necessary that it should agree with
the <i>subject</i> in gender and number; but the use of the singular is, nevertheless,
remarkable. If Shem and Japheth had been equally active, the latter also would,
at once, have been present to the mind of the writer. Under these circumstances,
there is the less reason for supposing that the use of the singular can be merely
accidental, especially as the words, &quot;and he told his <i>two brethren</i> without,&quot;
immediately precede. But all doubt is removed by a second allusion, which goes hand
in hand with the first, and which is contained in the following verse.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 24. &quot;<i>And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger
son had done unto him.</i>&quot;&mdash;That Ham was older than Japheth, appears from the circumstance
that the order in which the sons of Noah are introduced is uniformly thus: Shem,
Ham, Japheth; or, beginning, as in chap. x., from the youngest,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span> Japheth, Ham, Shem,&mdash;where, however, in ver.
21, the words added immediately after Shem&mdash;&quot;the elder brother of Japheth,&quot; expressly
indicate that, for a certain purpose, the writer has proceeded in order from the
youngest to the oldest. It is altogether in vain that some have attempted to prove
from chap. xi. 10 (according to which Shem was, two years after the flood, only
a hundred years old), compared with chap. v. 32 (according to which Noah began to
beget when he was five hundred years old), that Shem was not the first-born. The
words in chap. v. 32 are: &quot;And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begat Shem,
Ham, and Japheth.&quot; That the chronology can here be determined in a way which only
approximates to the truth, is implied, as a matter of course, in the statement,
that all the three sons were begotten when Noah was five hundred years of age; nothing
more is meant than that Noah begat them after he had finished his fifth, or at the
beginning of his sixth, century. (Compare <i>Ranke&#39;s Untersuchungen</i>.) It is
just an indefinite statement of time which points forward to another genealogy,
in which the details will be given with greater precision. Ham everywhere stands
between the two; but that, nevertheless, he is, in this passage, called the younger
son, can be explained only on the ground that, in the case before us, Shem and Ham
are the two more especially noticed&mdash;Shem as positively good, and Ham as positively
evil, while Japheth only takes part with Shem. We have thus laid an excellent foundation
for the right understanding of the subsequent prophetic utterance of Noah&mdash;for the
announcement, namely, of Japheth&#39;s dwelling in the tents of Shem.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 25. &quot;<i>And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants
shall he be to his brethren.</i>&quot;&mdash;<i>Luther</i> says: &quot;Good old Noah, who is regarded
by his son as a foolish and stupid old man, deserving only of mockery, appears here
in truly prophetic majesty, and announces to his sons a divine revelation of what
shall come to pass in future days; thus verifying what Paul says in 2 Cor. xii.,
that God&#39;s strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">According to the opinion now current, Canaan is said to mean &quot;lowland,&quot;
and to be transferred from the land to the people, and from the people to the pretended
ancestor. But this opinion is shown to be untenable by the considerations, that,
according to historical tradition, Canaan appears first as <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 33]</span> the name of the ancestor;&mdash;that the verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1504;&#1506;</span> is never used of natural lowness, but
always of humiliation;&mdash;that in our passage, where the name first occurs, it stands
in connection with servitude;&mdash;that the masculine form of the noun (on the adjective
termination <i>an</i>, compare <i>Ewald&#39;s Lehrb. d. Heb. Spr.</i> § 163, b.) is
not applicable to the country;&mdash;that the country Canaan is so far from being a lowland,
that it appears, everywhere in the Pentateuch, as a land of hills (see Deut. xi.
2, iii. 25, where the land itself is even called, &quot;that goodly mountain&quot;);<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_33a" href="#ftn_33a">[2]</a></sup>&mdash;and,
finally, that, from all appearance, Canaan is primarily the name, not of the country,
but of the people&mdash;the former being called <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; &#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503;</span>,
the land of Canaan.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The real etymology of the name is almost expressly given
in Judges iv. 23; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1506;</span>, &quot;and God bowed down,
or <i>humbled</i>, on that day Jabin the king of <i>Canaan</i>.&quot; Compare also Deut.
ix. 3, where, in reference to the Canaanites, it is said,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501;</span>, &quot;He will humble or subdue them;&quot;
and Nehem. ix. 24: &quot;Thou bowedest down before them the inhabitants of the land&mdash;the
Canaanites.&quot; Our passage also proceeds upon this interpretation of the name. We
are the rather induced to assume a connection betwixt the name &quot;Canaan,&quot; and the
words, &quot;a servant of servants shall he be,&quot; as in the case of Japheth also there
is certainly an allusion to the signification of the name, and probably in the case
of Shem also. Perhaps even the name Ham, <i>i.e.</i>, &quot;the blackish one,&quot; may be
connected with the character which he here displays&mdash;a suggestion which we do not
here follow up. We refer, however, for an analogy, to what has been remarked in
our Commentary on the Psalms, in the Introduction of Ps. vii.</p>
<p class="normal">Canaan means: &quot;the submissive one.&quot; It is a name which the people
themselves, on whose monuments it appears, would never have appropriated to themselves
(just as in the case of the Egyptians also, on which point <i>Gesenius</i> in the
<i>Thesaurus</i>, and my work <i>Egypt</i>, etc., p. 210, may be compared), unless
it had been proper to them from their very origin. Ham gave this name to his son
from the obedience which he demanded, but <span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span> did
not himself yield. The son was to be the servant of the father (for the name suggests
servile obedience), who was as despotical to his inferiors as he was rebellious
against his superiors. When the father gave that name to his son, he thought only
of submissiveness to <i>his</i> orders; but God, who, in His mysterious providence,
disposes of all these matters, had another submissiveness in view.</p>
<p class="normal">But why is Canaan cursed and not Ham? For an answer to this question,
we are at liberty neither to fall back upon the sovereign decree of God, as <i>Calvin</i>
does, nor to say with <i>Hofmann</i>: &quot;Canaan is the youngest son of Ham (Gen. x.
6); and because Ham, the youngest son of Noah, had caused so much grief to the father,
he, in return, is to experience great grief from his youngest son.&quot; This latter
view rests upon false historical suppositions. We have already proved that Ham was
not the youngest son of Noah; and it by no means follows from Gen. x. 6, that Canaan
was the youngest son of Ham. Canaan&#39;s name is mentioned last among the sons of Ham,
because the whole account of Ham&#39;s family was to be combined with the detailed enumeration
of Canaan&#39;s descendants, who stood in so important a relation to Israel. The boundary
line as regards Shem is formed, quite naturally, by that branch of Ham&#39;s family
which stood in so important a relation to the main branch of the family of Shem.
But, as little reliance can be placed upon the theological grounds of that conjecture;
for the question at issue is not the withdrawal of outward advantages. Canaan is
<i>cursed</i>, and it is just the sting of his servitude that it is the consequence
of the curse. It would indeed sadly affect the biblical doctrine of recompense,
if cursing and blessing were dependent upon such external reasons as, in the case
before us, upon the circumstance that Canaan was so unfortunate as to be the youngest
son.</p>
<p class="normal">The right answer to the question is without doubt this:&mdash;Ham is
punished in his son, just as he himself had sinned against his father. He is punished
in <i>this</i> son, because he followed most decidedly the example of his father&#39;s
impiety and wickedness. To this view we are led by the whole doctrine of Holy Scripture
concerning the visitation of the guilt of the fathers upon the children. (Compare
the author&#39;s &quot;<i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,&quot; vol. ii.
p. 373.) <span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span> To this view we are also led by the
passage in Gen. xv. 16: &quot;But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again,
for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.&quot; According to this passage, the
curse on Canaan can be realized upon him, only when his own iniquity has been fully
matured. This his iniquity is presupposed by his curse. If he were to be punished
on account of the guilt of the father,&mdash;a guilt in which he had no share,&mdash;then indeed
no delay would have been necessary. To this view we are farther led by what is reported
in Genesis concerning the moral depravity of Sodom and Gomorrah, which, in the development
of the sinful germ inherent in the race, had outrun all others, and were, therefore,
before all others, overtaken by punishment. (To this view we are further led by
what is reported in Genesis concerning the moral depravity of Sodom and Gomorrah,
which, in the development of the sinful germ inherent in the race, had outrun all
others, and were therefore, before all others, overtaken by punishment) To this
view we are led, <i>further</i>, by Lev. xviii. and the parallel passages, where
the Canaanites appear as a nation of abominations which the land spues out; and,
<i>finally</i>, by what ancient heathen writers report regarding the deep corruption
of the Ph&#339;nicians and Carthaginians.</p>
<p class="normal">The remainder of Ham&#39;s posterity are passed over in silence; it
is only in the sequel that we expect information regarding them. But the foreboding
arises, that their deliverance will be more difficult of accomplishment than that
of Japheth, although the circumstance that Canaan is singled out from among them
affords us decided hope for the rest.</p>
<p class="normal">But not even the exclusion of Ham is to be considered as an unavoidable
fate resting upon him. Heathenism alone knows such a curse. The subjective conditions
of the curse imply the possibility of becoming free from it. To this, there is an
express testimony in the circumstance, that the promise to the Patriarchs is not
limited. David received the remnant of the Canaanitish Jebusites into the congregation
of the Lord. (Compare remarks on Zech. ix. 7.) And, in the Gospels, the Canaanitish
woman appears as a representative of her nation, and as a proof the possibility,
granted to them, of breaking through the fetters of the curse. (Compare also the
remarkable passage, Ezek. xvi. 46.)</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The curse is contrasted with the blessing pronounced on Shem
and Japheth, and the second member of ver. 25 is, in vers. 26, 27, used as a repetition
in reference to each of the two brethren, who were, in it, viewed together.&quot;&mdash;(<i>Tuch.</i>)</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 26. &quot;<i>And he said: Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem;
and Canaan shall be a servant to them.</i>&quot;&mdash;The Patriarch Noah,&mdash;a just man, and
one who walked before God (Gen. vi. 9),&mdash;a man raised on high, as David says of himself
in 2 Sam. xxiii. 1,&mdash;a man whose utterances are not mere individual wishes, but,
at the same time, prophecies,&mdash;sees such rich blessings in store for his son, that,
instead of announcing them to him, he immediately breaks out into the praise of
God, who is the Author of them, and from whom the piety of Shem,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_36a" href="#ftn_36a">[3]</a></sup>
the foundation of this salvation, was derived, just as Moses, in Deut. xxx. 20,
instead of blessing Gad, blesses him by whom Gad is enlarged. The manner in which
God is here spoken of indicates, <i>indirectly</i>, what that is in which the blessing
consists. <i>First</i>,&mdash;God is not called by the name <i>Elohim</i> (which is expressive
of merely the most general outlines of His nature), but by the name <i>Jehovah</i>,
which has reference to His manifested personality, to His revelations, and to His
institutions for salvation.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_36b" href="#ftn_36b">[4]</a></sup>
<i>Secondly</i>,&mdash;Jehovah is called the God of Shem,&mdash;the first passage of Holy Scripture
in which God is called the God of some person. Both these circumstances indicate
that God is to enter into an altogether peculiar relation to the descendants of
Shem; that He will reveal Himself to them; establish His kingdom among them, and
make them partakers of both His earthly and His heavenly blessings. Thus <i>Luther</i>
says: &quot;This is indeed perceptible and clear, that he thus binds closely together
God and his son Shem, and, as it were, commits the one to the other. In this, he
indeed indicates the mystery of which Paul treats in Rom. xi. 11 sq., and Christ,
in John iv. 22, that salvation cometh from the Jews, but that, nevertheless, the
heathen shall become partakers of it. For <span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span> although
Shem alone be the real root and trunk, yet into this tree the Gentiles are, as a
strange branch, graffed, and enjoy the fatness and sap which are in the elect tree.
This light Noah, through the Holy Spirit, sees, and although he speaks dark words,
he yet prophesies very plainly, that the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ shall
be planted in the world, and shall grow up among the race of Shem, and not among
that of Japheth.&quot; As yet Shem and Japheth were on an equal footing. In the preceding
part of the narrative, nothing had been communicated by which God had, in His relation
to Shem, given up His nature as Elohim, and had become his God. It is only by anticipation,
then, that God can, in His relation to Shem, be designated as Jehovah, and as the
God of Shem. The thought can, when fully brought out, be this alone: &quot;Blessed be
God, who will, in future, reveal Himself as Jehovah, and as the God of Shem.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">If it be overlooked that, in this appellation of God, there is
implied the indirect designation of the blessings which are to be conferred on Shem
(just as in Gen. xxiv. 27 the words, &quot;Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham,&quot;
imply the thought: because He has manifested Himself as Jehovah, and as the God
of my master; which thought is then further carried out in the subsequent words:
&quot;And who hath not left destitute my master of His mercy and His truth;&quot;&mdash;and just
as it is also in the utterance of Zacharias in Luke i. 68, where the words, &quot;Blessed
be the Lord [<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>], the God of Israel,&quot; imply
the thought: because He has manifested Himself as the Lord [in the New Testament,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> is used where the Old has Jehovah],
the God of Israel),&mdash;if this be overlooked, we obtain only a weak and inadequate
thought, very unsuitable to the context, the purport of which evidently is to celebrate
Shem, and to mark him out as worthy of his name. So it is according to <i>Hofmann</i>,
who, in the words, &quot;Blessed&mdash;Shem,&quot; finds only an expression of gratitude for the
gift of this good son, and who limits the announcement of blessings to the single
one&mdash;that Canaan shall be Shem&#39;s servant. Against this feeble interpretation we must
adduce these considerations also: that nowhere does the gift of the good son form,
even indirectly, the subject in question;&mdash;that thus we should lose the opposition
of the curse and the blessing (which requires that, under <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 38]</span> the &quot;Blessed be Jehovah,&quot; we should have concealed the &quot;Blessed be
Shem&quot;), just as we should, the contrast between Jehovah here and Elohim in the following
verse;&mdash;and, lastly, that what, in the following verse, is said of Japheth&#39;s dwelling
in the tents of Shem, would thus be deprived of its necessary foundation.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">It is said: &quot;Canaan shall be a servant to <i>them</i>.&quot;
The suffix <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1464;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</span>, which cannot be used for
the singular, any more than can the suffix <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1464;&#1470;&#1501;</span>,
for which it is only the fuller poetical form (the instances of a different use,
adduced by <i>Ewald</i>, § 247, d., can easily be explained in accordance with the
rule), indicates that the announcement has no reference to the personal relation
of Shem and Ham, but that they come into view solely as the heads of families.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 27. &quot;<!--see 1854 ed.--><i>May God enlarge Japheth, and may
he dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be a servant to them.</i>&quot;&mdash;These
words, in the first instance, contain the blessing pronounced upon Japheth; but
they entitle us to infer from them, at the same time, a glorious blessing destined
for Shem, which is the source of blessing to Japheth also. They thus complete the
promise of the preceding verse, which directly refers to Shem.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The first clause of this verse has received a great
variety of interpretations. The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span>,
which refers to, and is explanatory of, the name <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1497;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</span> (<i>i.e.</i> Japheth), is the future apoc. <i>Hiphil</i> of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</span>. The <i>Piel</i> of this verb has in
Hebrew commonly the signification: &quot;to persuade, or prevail upon any one to do anything.&quot;
Hence many interpreters translate with <i>Calvin</i>: &quot;May God allure Japheth that
he may dwell in the tents of Shem.&quot; <i>Luther</i> also, in his Commentary, thus
explains it: &quot;God will kindly speak to Japheth;&quot; while, in his translation, he has:
&quot;May God enlarge Japheth.&quot;&mdash;But to this interpretation it has been rightly objected,
that the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1492;</span> is found only in Piel, not
in Hiphil, with the signification &quot;to persuade;&quot; that, commonly, it signifies &quot;to
persuade&quot; only in a bad sense; and that, in this sense, it is never construed with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span>, but always with the accusative.&mdash;All interpreters
now agree that (in conformity with the LXX. [<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#953;
&#8001; &#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#7992;&#8049;&#966;&#949;&#952;</span>], the <i>Vulgate</i> [<i>dilatet Deus Japhet</i>], and <i>
Onkelos</i>) <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> must be derived from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1492;</span> in its primary signification, &quot;to be wide,
large,&quot; in which it is found in Prov. xx. 19 (where
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
is accusative denoting the place), and which signification is the common one in
Aramaic. But they then again disagree, inasmuch as some think of a local extension:
God shall give to Japheth a numerous posterity, which shall take possession of extended
territories; while others find here expressed the idea of general prosperity: God
shall prosper Japheth, shall bring him into a free and unstraitened position.</p>
<p class="normal">Both of these views partake of alike mistake from regarding the
words <i>per se</i>, and as disconnected from the following announcement of Japheth&#39;s
dwelling in the tents of Shem. It must also be objected to them, that in the case
of Shem, only one feature of the blessing is pointed out, viz., that God will be
to him Jehovah, <i>his</i> God; and so, likewise, only one feature of the curse
in the case of Ham. When those words are isolated, separated from what follows,
and understood of extension, this difficulty arises, that Ham enjoys this extension
in common with Japheth, as is shown by a glance at Gen. x. If, on the other hand,
we understand them as expressive of prosperity (according to <i>Hofmann</i>: &quot;general
prosperity in the affairs of outward life&quot;), this explanation is destitute of a
sufficient foundation, and there is nothing reported in the sequel regarding the
fulfilment of such a promise. To this we must further add, that the verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1508;&#1514;</span> is, on account of its immediate nearness
to the proper name, too little expressive, and that, hence, we must expect to find
its meaning more fully brought out in what follows.</p>
<p class="normal">But if it be acknowledged that the extension appears here as a
blessing, in so far only as it leads to the dwelling in the tents of Shem, mentioned
in the subsequent clause of the verse, and that the blessing can consist in nothing
else, there is then no essential difference betwixt the two interpretations. But
we decide in favour of the <i>latter</i> view, because the corresponding verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1489;</span>, &quot;to make wide, to enlarge,&quot; when construed
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span>, is always used in the signification:
&quot;to bring into a free, unstraitened, easy, happy position.&quot; (See, <i>e.g.</i>, Gen.
xxvi. 22; Ps. iv. 2; Prov. xviii. 16; 2 Sam. xxii. 20.) Even when followed by an
accusative, the verb is found with this signification in Deut. xxxiii. 20: &quot;Blessed
be He that enlargeth Gad.&quot; (In this passage, too, the word has been understood as
denoting extension; and Deut. xii. 20, xix. 8, have been appealed to in support
of the opinion; but this appeal is inadmissible, because <span class="pagenum">[Pg
40]</span> extension of the borders is the thing which is there spoken of. The allusion
to the signification of the name <i>Gad</i> = good luck [Gen. xxx. 11: &quot;And Leah
said, For good luck;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_40a" href="#ftn_40a">[5]</a></sup>
and she called his name Gad&quot;], is favourable to our view, as well as the circumstance,
that in this case the subsequent words are only an expansion of the general thought,
and more closely determine the happiness. Jehovah, who enlarges Gad, according to
the words which follow, &quot;He dwelleth like a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown
of the head,&quot; is contrasted with the enemies who wish to drive him into a strait.
If room be made for him, he becomes happy, as it were, by enlargement.) To understand
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> of prosperity and happiness, is countenanced
also by the consideration that, in such circumstances, the name Japheth appears
much more appropriate in the mouth of Noah, by whom it was uttered at a time when
extension could be but little thought of, and that it corresponds much better with
the name Shem.</p>
<p class="normal">Elohim is to enlarge Japheth. Elohim here stands in strict contrast
with Jehovah, the God of Shem. It is only by dwelling in the tents of Shem, that
Japheth passes over into the territory of Jehovah,&mdash;up to that time, he belongs to
the territory of Elohim. But Elohim leads him to Jehovah. It is a contrast in all
respects similar to that which we have in Gen. xiv., where, in verse 19, Melchizedek
speaks of &quot;the most high God,&quot; whose priest he is, according to verse 20; while
Abraham, on the contrary, speaks, in verse 22, of &quot;Jehovah the most high God.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">There is a difference of opinion regarding the determination of
the subject in the second clause of the verse: &quot;and he shall dwell in the tents
of Shem.&quot; According to a very ancient interpretation, Elohim is to be supplied as
such; from which the following sense would be obtained: &quot;God shall indeed enlarge
and prosper Japheth, but He shall dwell in the tents of Shem.&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span> The inferior blessing of Japheth would thus
be contrasted with the superior one of Shem, among whose posterity God should, by
His gracious presence, glorify Himself,&mdash;first in the tabernacle, then in the temple,
and lastly, should, in the highest sense, dwell by the incarnation of His Son. Thus
<i>Onkelos</i>: &quot;God shall extend Japheth, and His Shechinah shall dwell in the
tents of Shem.&quot; The ancient book <i>Breshith Rabba</i> remarks on this passage:
&quot;The Shechinah dwells only in the tents of Shem.&quot; (See <i>Schöttgen</i>, <i>de Messia</i>,
p. 441.) <i>Theodoret</i> also (Interrog. 58 in Genesin) advances this explanation,
and ably brings out this sense. It has of late been again defended by <i>Hofmann</i>
and <i>Baumgarten</i>. But against this view there are decisive arguments, which
show that Japheth alone can be the subject. To mention only a few:&mdash;It cannot be
doubted that it is on purpose that Noah, when speaking of Shem, has chosen the name
Jehovah, and that, as soon as he comes to Japheth, he makes use of the name Elohim.
We cannot, therefore, suppose that here, where, according to this interpretation,
he would just touch upon the essential point in the peculiar relation of Jehovah
to the descendants of Shem&mdash;the Israelites, he should have made use of the general
name of Elohim, as in the case of Japheth. The subject&mdash;Jehovah&mdash;could not in this
case have been omitted before <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1499;&#1503;</span>. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;By
such an interpretation we are involved in inextricable difficulties as regards the
last clause of the verse. The words, &quot;And Canaan shall be a servant to them,&quot; can
neither be referred to Shem alone&mdash;for, in that case, they would be an useless repetition,
as in ver. 25 Canaan had been doomed to be a servant to <i>his brethren</i>&mdash;nor
can they be referred to Shem and Japheth at the same time; the analogy of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;</span> in the preceding verse, where the plural
referred to the plurality represented by the one Shem, forbids this. If, then, the
last clause can refer to Japheth only, the clause in which the dwelling in the tents
of Shem is spoken of, must likewise be referred to Japheth. To these arguments we
may <i>further</i> add, that there is something altogether strange in the expression:
&quot;God shall dwell in the tents of Shem.&quot; There is, in Holy Scripture, frequent mention
of God&#39;s dwelling in His tabernacle, on His holy hill, in Zion, in the midst of
the children of Israel. Believers also are said to dwell in the tabernacle or temple
of God; but nowhere is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span> God spoken of as dwelling
in the tents of Israel. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;If we refer the second clause to Shem, the
first, in its detached position, would be too general, too indefinite, and too loose
to admit of the blessing of Japheth being concluded with it. We must not, moreover,
lose sight of the consideration, that when we refer the second clause also to Japheth,
there springs up a beautiful connection between the relation of Shem and Japheth
to each other in the present, and during their future progress. As the reaction
against the corruption of Ham had originated with Shem, and Japheth had only joined
him in it; so in future also, the real home of piety and salvation will be with
Shem, to whom Japheth, in the felt need of salvation, shall come near. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;The
analogy of the promise made to the Patriarch, according to which all the nations
of the earth shall be blessed by the seed of Abraham, is in favour of our referring
the second clause to Japheth. And if the Lord, alluding to our passage, says, in
Luke xvi. 9, &quot;Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that
when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations&quot; (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;</span>
= <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;</span>), He expresses the view which we are
now defending. For, in that passage, it is not God who receives, but man: they who,
by their prayers, are more advanced, come to the help of those who have made less
progress; those who have already attained to the enjoyment of salvation, make them
partakers who stand in need of salvation.</p>
<p class="normal">Of those who correctly consider Japheth to be the subject, several
(<i>J. D. Michaelis</i>, <i>Vater</i>, <i>Gesenius</i>, <i>Winer</i>, <i>Knobel</i>)
give the translation: &quot;and he shall dwell in renowned habitations.&quot; But it is quite
evident that this sense is admissible only as a secondary one: as such, we must
indeed admit it in a context in which the appellative signification of the proper
names is never lost sight of. That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501;</span> is here,
however, primarily a proper name, is shown by the preceding verse.</p>
<p class="normal">The translation, &quot;Japheth shall dwell in the tents of Shem,&quot; is,
then, the correct one. But now the question is,&mdash;How are these words to be understood?
According to the views of many interpreters, it is intimated by Japheth&#39;s dwelling
in the tents of Shem, that the true religion would be preserved among the posterity
of Shem, and would pass over from them to the descendants of Japheth, who should
be received into the community <span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span> of the worshippers
of the true God. So <i>Jonathan</i> explained its meaning: &quot;The Lord shall make
glorious the end of Japheth; his sons shall be proselytes, and shall dwell in the
schools of Shem.&quot; So also <i>Jerome</i>: &quot;Since it is said, And he shall dwell in
the tents of <i>Shem</i>, this is a prophecy concerning us, who, after the rejection
of Israel, enjoy the instruction and knowledge of the Scriptures.&quot; <i>Augustine</i>
also (<i>c. Faustum</i> xii. 24) understands by the tents of Shem, &quot;the churches
which the apostles, the sons of the prophets, have built up.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">But although this explanation be, in the main, correct, it cannot,
per se, satisfy us. It must be reconciled with that other explanation given by
<i>Bochart</i> (<i>Phaleg.</i> iii. 1 c. 147 sqq.), <i>Calmet</i>, <i>Clericus</i>,
and others, according to which the passage is to be understood literally, as foretelling
that the posterity of Japheth should, at some future time, gain possession of the
country belonging to the descendants of Shem, and should reduce them to subjection.</p>
<p class="normal">The phrase, &quot;and they dwelt in their tents,&quot; is, in 1 Chron. v.
10, used to express the relation of conquerors and conquered. There is no parallel
passage which could indubitably prove that &quot;dwelling in the tents of some one&quot; could
ever, by itself, denote spiritual communion with him. If Shem had come to Japheth
with the announcement of salvation only, it is not likely that a dwelling of Japheth
in the tents of Shem would have been spoken of. Even the last clause of the verse&mdash;&quot;and
Canaan shall be a servant to them&quot;&mdash;when compared with the preceding verse, according
to which Canaan is, in the first place, to be Shem&#39;s servant only, supposes that
Japheth will step beyond his borders, and will invade the territory naturally belonging
to Shem. If Japheth assume the dominion of Shem over Canaan, he must then dwell
in the tents of Shem in a sense different from the merely spiritual one. <i>Finally</i>&mdash;Even
in other passages of the Pentateuch, an invasion of Shem&#39;s territory by Japheth
is foretold. In Num. xxiv. 24, Balaam says: &quot;And ships shall come from the coast
of Chittim and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish.&quot;
&quot;We have here (compare my monography on Balaam) the announcement of a future conquest
of the Asiatic kingdoms by nations from Europe, such as was historically realized
in the Asiatic dominion of the Greeks and Romans.&quot;</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<p class="normal">On the other hand, however, it must not by any means be supposed
that Noah should, in favour of Japheth, have weakened the power of the brilliant
promise given to Shem by the announcement of such a sad event; for it is evidently
his intention to exalt Shem above his brethren, as highly as he had excelled them
both in his piety towards his father.</p>
<p class="normal">The difficulties which stand in the way of either explanation
are easily removed by the following consideration. The occupation of the land of
Shem by Japheth is the condition of Japheth&#39;s dwelling in the tents of Shem. Why
this dwelling is a blessing to Japheth&mdash;&quot;God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall
dwell,&quot; etc.&mdash;appears from what precedes, according to which, God reveals Himself
to Shem as Jehovah, and becomes <i>his</i> God. To be received into the fellowship
of Jehovah&mdash;to find Him in the tents of Shem&mdash;constitutes the blessing promised to
Japheth. But if such be the case, there can be no more room for speaking of an announcement
of any event adverse to Shem. Underneath the adversity, joy is hidden. It will here
be fulfilled in its highest sense, that the conquered give laws to the conquerors.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And Canaan shall be a servant to them.&quot; The servitude of Canaan
was completed by Japheth, among whose sons (Gen. x. 2) Madai also appears; so that
even the Medo-Persian kingdom is one of Japheth&#39;s. Ph&#339;nicia was completely overthrown
by him. Haughty Tyrus fell to the ground. Zech. ix. 3, 4, when announcing the Greek
dominion (compare ver. 13), says: &quot;And Tyrus did build herself a stronghold, and
heaped up silver like dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. Behold, the
Lord will cast her out, and He will smite her power in the sea, and she shall be
devoured with fire.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The objection raised by <i>Tuch</i> and <i>Hofmann</i>, that the
Greeks and Romans made Shem also their servant, is, after what has been remarked,
destitute of all weight, inasmuch as the servitude then had reference only to the
lower territory. Shem and Judah were not injured in that which, in ver. 26, had
been pointed at as their chief and peculiar good. On the contrary, it shone out,
on that occasion, in its highest glory. Canaan, however, lost that upon which he
set the highest value. In the case of Canaan, the servitude was the consequence
of the curse; but in the case of Shem, the outward servitude was a consequence of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span> the blessing, the most emphatic verification
of the words: &quot;Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It must indeed fill us with adoring wonder when we see how clearly
and distinctly the outlines of the world&#39;s history, as well as of the history of
Salvation, are here traced. &quot;This,&quot; says <i>Calvin</i>, &quot;is indeed a support to
our faith of no common strength, that the calling of the Gentiles was not only predestined
in God&#39;s eternal decree, but also publicly proclaimed by the mouth of the Patriarch;
so that we are not required to believe that by a sudden and fortuitous event merely,
the inheritance of eternal life was proclaimed to all men in common.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It is not a matter of <i>chance</i> that this prophecy was given
immediately after the deluge, which stands out as so great an event in the history
of the fallen human race,&mdash;the first event, indeed, subsequent to the fall, with
which the <i>Protevangelium</i> was connected. A new period begins with the calling
of Abraham, and in it we obtain another link in the chain of the prophecies,&mdash;a link
which fits as exactly into that which is now under consideration, as did this into
the <i>Protevangelium</i>. The import of this prophecy is: &quot;The kingdom of God shall
be established in Shem, and Japheth shall be received into its community.&quot;&mdash;The meaning
of the prophecy which is now to engage our attention is: &quot;By the posterity of the
Patriarchs all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.&quot; The promise to the Patriarchs
differs, however, from the prophecy upon which we have just commented, not only
in the natural progress&mdash;that from among the descendants of Shem a narrower circle
is separated&mdash;but in this circumstance also, that in the former the blessing is extended
to all the nations of the earth, while in the latter Ham is passed over in silence.
This difference, however, has its main foundation in the historical circumstances
of the latter prophecy; although, it is true, the complete silence which is observed
regarding him, calls forth apprehensions about his being less susceptible of salvation,
or, at least, of his not occupying any prominent position in the development of
the kingdom of God. Here, where the object was to punish Ham for his wickedness,
not the prosperous, but the adverse events impending upon him in his posterity,
are brought prominently out; while, on the other hand, to Shem and Japheth blessings
alone are foretold.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_46" href="#div2Ref_46">THE PROMISE TO THE PATRIARCHS.</a></h2>
<p class="normal">A great epoch is, in Genesis, ushered in with the history of the
time of the Patriarchs. <i>Luther</i> says: &quot;This is the third period in which Holy
Scripture begins the history of the Church with a new family.&quot; In a befitting manner,
the representation is opened in Gen. xii. 1-3 by an account of the first revelation
of God, given to Abraham at Haran, in which the way is opened up for all that follows,
and in which the dispensations of God are brought before us in a rapid survey. Abraham
is to forsake everything, and then God will give him everything.</p>
<p class="normal">Gen. xii. 1. &quot;<i>And the Lord said unto Abraham, Get thee out
of thy country, and from thy hone, and from thy father&#39;s house, into a land that
I will show thee.</i> Ver. 2. <i>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will
bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.</i> Ver. 3.
<i>And I will bless them that bless thee, and him who curseth thee I will curse:
and in thee all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Into a land that I will show thee.</i>&quot; From what follows,
it appears that, in the very same revelation, the country was afterwards <i>more
definitely</i> pointed out; for Abraham, without having received any new revelation,
goes to Canaan, For the sake of brevity, the writer gives the details only afterwards,
when he has occasion to report how they were carried out. The land which God will
show to Abraham, stands contrasted with that in which he is at home,&mdash;in which he
and his whole being had taken root. This contrast points out the greatness of the
sacrifice which God demands of Abraham. With a like intent we have the accumulation
of expressions&mdash;&quot;out of thy land,&quot; etc.&mdash;corresponding to a similar one when the command
was given to sacrifice Isaac (Gen. xxii. 2), and forming the condition of the promise
which follows. This promise is intended to make the sacrifice a light thing to Abraham,
by pointing out what he is to receive if he give up everything which stands in the
way of his living to God. A similar call comes to all who feel impelled to renounce
the world in order to serve God. This call to Abraham is peculiar only as to its
form; as to its essence, it is ever repeating itself. This will appear the more
distinctly, when we inquire into the true reason of the <i>outward</i> separation
here demanded of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span> Abraham. It can be Intended
only as a means of the internal separation. In the circle in which he lived, sin
had already made a mighty progress, as appears from Josh. xxiv. 2,&mdash;a passage which
shows us that idolatry had already made its way into the family of Abraham. In order
to withdraw him from the influences of this corruption, Abraham is removed from
the circle in which he had grown up, and in which he had hitherto moved. That the
special thing here demanded is only the result of the general duty of renunciation
and self-denial, which is here, in Abraham, laid upon the whole Church, appears
from the circumstance, that the promise was renewed at a subsequent period, when,
with a willing heart, he had offered up his son Isaac as a spiritual sacrifice to
his God. The carnal, ungodly love to Isaac is thus placed on a level with the attachment
to the land, etc., which came betwixt him and his God. The general idea, that self-renunciation
lies at the foundation, is brought out in Psalm xlv. 11.</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;<i>And thou shalt be a blessing</i>,&quot; imply more than
the words, &quot;I will bless thee:&quot; they are intentionally placed in the centre of the
whole promise. Abraham shall, as it were, be an embodied blessing&mdash;himself blessed,
and the cause of blessing to all those who bless him&mdash;to all the generations of the
earth who shall, at some future period, enter into this loving and grateful relation
to him. On the ground of Abraham&#39;s self-denial, and unreserved surrender, blessing
is poured out <i>upon him</i>, blessing also <i>on his account</i> and <i>through
him</i>. The blessing connected with him begins with himself, and extends over all
the families of the earth.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;<i>And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth
thee I will curse.</i> The blessing is based upon the turning to Him who has appointed
Abraham for a blessing, as we may learn from the example of Melchizedek, Gen. xiv.
19. They who bless are themselves not far from the kingdom of God; blessing, therefore,
is the preparatory step towards being blessed. (Compare Matt. x. 40-42.)</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;<i>And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</i>&quot;
<i>Luther</i> says: &quot;Now there follows the right promise, which ought to be written
in golden letters, and proclaimed in all lands, and for which we ought to praise
and glorify.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The promise stands here in close connection with the Mosaic
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span> history of the creation. According to that,
man, as such, bears upon him the impress of the divine image. Gen. i. 26, and is
the depository of the divine breath. Gen. ii. 7. From such a beginning, we cannot
conceive of any limitation of salvation which is not, at the same time, a means
of its universal extension. It must therefore be in entire accordance with the nature
of the thing, that even here, where the setting apart of a particular chosen race
takes its rise, there should be an intimation of its universally comprehensive object.
There is, in the circumstance of <i>families</i> being spoken of, a distinct reference
to the history of creation; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492;</span> everywhere
corresponds exactly with our word &quot;family.&quot; It is everywhere used only of the subdivisions
in the greater body of the nation or tribe. The expression, then, points to the
higher unity of the whole human race, as it has its foundation in the fact that
all partake in common of the divine image.</p>
<p class="normal">The announcement of the blessing in this passage leads us back
to the curse pronounced in consequence of sin, Gen. iii. 17: &quot;Cursed is the ground
(<i>Adamah</i>) for thy sake.&quot; (Compare Gen. v. 29.) This curse is, at some future
time, to be abolished by Abraham. We can account for the mention of the families
of the &quot;Adamah&quot; only by supposing that a reference to this passage was fully intended;
for it was just the &quot;Adamah&quot; (primarily, &quot;land&quot;) which had there been designated
as the object of the curse.</p>
<p class="normal">In announcing that all the families shall be blessed in Abraham,
the writer refers also to the judgment described in Gen. xi., by which the family
of mankind,&mdash;which, according to the intention of God, ought to have been united,&mdash;was
dispersed and separated. When viewed in this connection, we expect that the blessing
will manifest itself in the healing of the deep wound inflicted upon mankind, in
the re-establishment of the lost unity, and in the gathering again of the scattered
human race around Abraham as their centre.</p>
<p class="normal">Beyond this, no other disclosure about the nature of this salvation
is given. But that it consisted essentially in the union with God accomplished through
the medium of Abraham, and that everything else could be viewed as emanating only
from this source, was implied simply in the circumstance, that all the blessing
which Abraham enjoyed for himself had its origin in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
this, that he could call God <i>his God</i>; just as, in Gen. ix., it had been declared
as the blessing of Shem, that Jehovah should be his God, and as the blessing of
Japheth, that he was called to become a partaker of this blessing. The blessings
which were either bestowed upon or promised to the Patriarchs and their descendants,
had for their object the advancement of knowledge and the practice of true religion,
and had been bestowed or promised only under this condition (compare Gen. xvii.
1, xvii. 17-19, xxii. 16-18, xxvi. 5); they could not hence expect anything else
than that their posterity would, in so far, be the cause of the salvation of the
heathen nations, that the latter should, by means of the former, be made partakers
of the blessings of true religion.</p>
<p class="normal">With regard to the manner in which this blessing was to come to
the Gentiles, no intimation was given by the words themselves. The person of the
Redeemer is not yet brought before us in them; the indication of that was reserved
for a later stage in the progress of revelation.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_49a" href="#ftn_49a">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">The last clause of ver. 3 cannot, by any means, take away from
the import of the preceding one; the announcement of the blessing which, through
Abraham, is to come upon all the families of the earth, does not repeal the foregoing
one, according to which all shall be cursed who curse him. This view is confirmed
by an allusion to this announcement in Zech. xiv. 16-19, where the words, &quot;the families
of the earth,&quot; must be regarded as a quotation. In ver. 16, the prophet says that
<i>all the Gentiles</i> shall go up to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles;
but then, in vers. 17-19, he intimates the punishment of those who should refuse
to go up. <i>Luther</i> says: &quot;If you wish to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
comprehend in a few words the history of the Church from the time of Abraham down
to our days, then consider diligently these four verses. For in them you will find
the blessing; but you will see also, that those who curse the Church are cursed,
in turn, by God; so that they must perish, while the eternal seed of the Church
stands unmoved and unshaken. For which reason, this text agrees with the first promise
given in Paradise, concerning the seed which is to bruise the serpent&#39;s head. For
the Church is not without enemies, but is assailed and harassed so that she groans
under it; but yet, by this seed, she is invincible, and shall at length be victorious,
and triumphant over all her enemies, in eternity.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">References to this fundamental prophecy are found in other parts
of the Old Testament, besides the passage just quoted from Zechariah. In the 28th
verse of Ps. xxii., which was written by David, it is said: &quot;All the ends of the
world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the <i>families</i> of the
Gentiles shall worship before Thee.&quot; The realization of the blessing announced in
Genesis, to all the families of the earth, appears in this psalm as being connected
with the wonderful deliverance of the just. Another reference is in Ps. lxxii.,
which was written by Solomon. In ver. 17 of this psalm it is said of Solomon&#39;s great
Antitype: &quot;And they shall bless themselves in Him, all nations shall bless Him.&quot;
In these words the realization of the Abrahamitic blessing is distinctly connected
with the person of the Redeemer.</p>
<p class="normal">Among the New Testament references, the most remarkable is in
John viii. There, in ver. 53, the Jews say to Christ: &quot;Art thou greater than our
father Abraham, which is dead? Whom makest thou thyself?&quot; Jesus, in ver. 56, answers:
&quot;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad,&quot; In ver.
57 the Jews reply: &quot;Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?&quot;
In ver. 58 Jesus thus says to them: &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
was, I am.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Let us here, in the first place, consider only the declaration
of Jesus, that Abraham rejoiced to see His day, and was glad. It is altogether out
of the question to think of any such explanation of this as the one given by <i>
Lücke</i>, after the example of <i>Lampe</i> namely: &quot;that Abraham, in the heavenly
life, as a blessed <span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span> spirit with God, saw the
day of the Lord, and in heaven rejoiced in the fulfilment.&quot; For it is the custom
of Jesus to argue with the Jews from <i>Scripture</i>; and He cannot, therefore,
here be appealing to an assumed fact which could not be proved from it. The answer
of the Jews, in ver. 57, is likewise opposed to such an explanation, inasmuch as
it proceeds from a supposition which Jesus had acknowledged to be true, namely,
that the question at issue was a meeting of Christ with Abraham not mentioned in
history; and in ver. 58 Christ sets aside their argument, &quot;Thou art not yet fifty
years old.&quot; But <i>Lücke</i> must himself bear testimony against his own interpretation,
inasmuch as, according to it, he is obliged to speak of &quot;the very foolish question
of the adversaries.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_51a" href="#ftn_51a">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">Jesus saw Abraham, and Abraham saw Jesus. Not the person, but
the day of Christ, was future to Abraham. And this can be explained only by Jesus&#39;
being concealed behind Jehovah who appeared to him, and gave him the promise, that
in him and his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed. This blessing
of all the families of the earth is the day of Jehovah,&mdash;the day when He will be
glorified on the earth.</p>
<p class="normal">The key to the right understanding of this is furnished by the
doctrine of the Angel of the Lord, which meets us as early as in Genesis. From the
passages in which, at the appearances and revelations of Jehovah, the mediation
of the Angel is expressly mentioned, we infer that it (the mediation) took place
even when Jehovah by Himself is spoken of; and the more so, since, even in the former
series of passages, the simple name of Jehovah is commonly varied by that of the
Angel of Jehovah. The Evangelist John&#39;s whole doctrine of the <i>Logos</i> points
to the personal identity of Jesus with the Angel of the Lord. Not less so does the
passage, John xii. 41; and there is unquestionably a purpose which cannot be misunderstood
in the fact, that, throughout the discourses of Jesus, as reported by John, the
declaration that God <i>sent</i> Him occurs with such frequency and regularity.
But we can scarcely conceive of any other purpose than that of marking out Jesus
as the Angel or Messenger of Jehovah spoken of in the writings of the Old Testament.
Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, xii. 44, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span> 45: &quot;Jesus cried
and said, He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him that <i>sent</i>
Me; and he that seeth Me, seeth Him that <i>sent</i> Me.&quot; So also iv. 34, v. 23,
24, 30, 37, vi. 38-40, vii. 16, 28, 33, viii. 16, 18, 26, 29, ix. 4, xii. 49, xiii.
20, xiv. 24, xv. 21, xvi. 5.</p>
<p class="normal">Let us now, in addition, turn to the words, &quot;Abraham rejoiced
to see (literally, that he might see) My day.&quot; It cannot be liable to any doubt,
that these words express the heartfelt, joyful desire of Abraham to see that day,
and that <i>Bengel</i> correctly explains it by the words: <i>gestivit cum desiderio</i>.
It is true, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#953;&#8049;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> signifies, by itself,
only &quot;to rejoice;&quot; but it has added to it the idea of joyful desire by its being
connected with <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span>. The words now under consideration
are expressive of Abraham&#39;s joy and longing in the spirit for the manifestation
of the day of Jehovah and of Christ, while those in the last clause of the verse
express the gratification of this longing, which was produced by his receiving the
promise that all the families of the earth should be blessed.</p>
<p class="normal">The ardent desire of Abraham to see the day of Christ implies
that he already <i>knew</i> Christ, which can be the case only on the supposition
of Christ&#39;s concealment in Jehovah. This longing desire is not expressly mentioned
in Genesis, but it is most intimately connected with all living faith, and must
necessarily precede such divine communications. The seed of the divine promises
is everywhere sown only in a well prepared soil. That the promise in 2 Sam. vii.
was to David, in like manner, a gratification of his anxious desire&mdash;an answer to
prayer&mdash;we are not, it is true, expressly told in the historical record; and yet,
that it was so, is evident from the words of Ps. xxi. 3: &quot;Thou hast given him his
heart&#39;s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips.&quot; There is here,
then, express mention made of that which is a matter of course, and which forms
the necessary condition of that which was reported in Genesis.</p>
<p class="normal">We are furnished by the Book of Genesis itself with the right
explanation of what is meant by the day of Christ, about which interpreters have
so frequently erred. It is not the time of His first appearing, but, in accordance
with the New Testament mode of expression (<i>e.g.</i>, Phil. i. 10), the time of
His glorification. The day of Christ is the time when the promise, &quot;In thee shall
all the families of the earth be blessed,&quot; shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="normal"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span> Peter quotes this promise
in Acts iii. 25, 26. Among the families of the earth he enumerates, first and chiefly,
the people of the Old Testament dispensation; and he does so with perfect propriety,
since there is no warrant whatever for limiting it to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="normal">Paul probably refers to this promise when, in Rom. iv. 13, he
speaks of a promise given to Abraham and his seed that he should be the heir of
the world. A blessing imparted to the whole world is a spiritual victory obtained
over the world. The world is, in a spiritual sense, conquered by Abraham and his
seed. Express references are found in Gal. iii. 8, 14, 16.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The same promise is repeated to Abraham in Gen. xviii.
18. Instead of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;</span> (the families
of the earth), the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span> (the nations
of the earth) are there mentioned; the family-connection is lost sight of, and the
comprehensiveness only&mdash;the catholic character of the blessing&mdash;is prominently brought
out. This promise is a third time repeated to Abraham in chap. xxii. 18, on a very
appropriate occasion, even that on which, by his endurance of the greatest trial,
and by his willingness to sacrifice to God even what was dearest to him, he had
proved himself a worthy heir of it. It is certainly not a matter of mere accident
that this promise is just three times given to Abraham. There is in this a correspondence
with the three individuals to whom the same promise is addressed. Abraham, however,
as the first of them, and as the father of the faithful, could not be put on the
same footing with the others. Instead of &quot;in thee,&quot;<!--inserted quote 1854 --> or
&quot;by thee&quot; (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1498;</span>), we read in xxii. 18, &quot;in&quot;
or &quot;by thy seed&quot; (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498;</span>). The same promise
is confirmed to Isaac in chap. xxvi. 14, and it is transferred to Jacob in chap.
xxviii. 14. But while, in the first and second passages, it is said, &quot;by thee,&quot;
and in the third and fourth, &quot;by thy seed,&quot; we read, in the passage last mentioned,
&quot;by thee and thy seed.&quot; This evidently shows that, in those passages where we find
&quot;by thee&quot; standing alone, we are not at liberty to explain it as meaning simply:
&quot;by thy seed.&quot; It is not only the seed of Abraham, but Abraham himself also, who
is to be the medium of blessing to the nations, as the foundation-stone of the large
building of the Church of God, as the father of our Lord Jesus Christ according
to the flesh, and as the father of all believers.</p>
<p class="normal">There is a deep reason for the fact that, wherever the posterity
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span> of the Patriarchs are spoken of as the instruments
of blessing, the singular is always used. This circumstance is pointed out by Paul
in Gal. iii. 16. The Apostle does not in the least think of maintaining that, by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;</span> &quot;seed,&quot; only a single individual could
be signified. Such an opinion, no one who understood Hebrew could for a moment entertain;
and Rom. iv. 13 shows that Paul was indeed very far from doing so. The further development
of the promise (which took place within the limits of Genesis itself, in chap. xlix.
10), as well as its fulfilment (it is, indeed, with reference to the promise now
under consideration that the lineal descent of Christ from Abraham is established
at the commencement of Matthew&#39;s Gospel), showed that the real cause of the salvation
bestowed upon the Gentiles was not the seed of Abraham as a whole, but one from
among them, or rather He, in whom this whole posterity was comprehended and concentrated.
Now, all to which Paul intends to draw our attention is the fact, that the Lord,
who, when He gave the promise, had already in view its fulfilment which He had Himself
to accomplish, did not unintentionally choose an expression which, besides the comprehensive
meaning which would most naturally suggest itself to the Patriarchs, admitted also
of the more restricted one which was confirmed by the fulfilment. In the <i>Protevangelium</i>,
and in the promise of the Prophet in Deut. xviii., we have a case quite analogous
to this; and in 2 Sam. vii. there is likewise a case which is, to a certain extent,
parallel.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">In two passages out of the five&mdash;in chap. xxii. 18 and
xxvi. 4&mdash;the Hithpael of the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;</span> instead
of the Niphal is found. We meet with it also again in the derived passage in Ps.
lxxii. 17, where it is said of the great King to come, &quot;And they shall bless themselves
in Him, all nations shall bless Him.&quot; In xxii. 18 and xxvi. 4, we shall be allowed
to translate only thus: &quot;They shall bless themselves in thy seed.&quot; For the Hithpael
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;</span> always signifies &quot;to bless oneself;&quot;
and the person from whom the blessing is derived (Isa. lxv. 16; Jer. iv. 2), or
whose blessing is desired, is connected with it by means of the preposition
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>. (Compare Gen. xlviii. 20: &quot;In thee shall
Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.&quot;) From the nature
of the case, it is evident that only the latter can be meant here. This is shown
also by the derived passage <span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span> in Ps. lxxii. 17,
where the words, &quot;they shall bless themselves in Him,&quot; are explained by the subsequent
expression, &quot;they shall bless Him.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">But it is certainly not accidental that the Hithpael is on both
sides inclosed by the Niphal, and that the latter stands not only twice at the beginning,
but also at the end. Hence we are not at liberty to force upon the Hithpael the
signification of the Niphal; but the passages in which the Hithpael occurs must
be supplemented from the real fundamental passages. &quot;To bless oneself <i>in</i>&quot;
is the preparatory step to being &quot;blessed <i>by</i>.&quot; The acknowledgment of the
blessing calls forth the wish to be a partaker of it. (Compare Isa. xlv. 14, where,
in consequence of the rich blessings poured out upon Israel, the nations make the
request to be received among them.) Oftentimes in the Psalms utterance is given
to the expectation that, through the blessing resting on the people of God, the
Gentiles will be allowed to seek communion in it. (<!--see 1854 ed.-->See my Commentary
on Ps. vol. iii. p. lxxvii.) But especially in Ps. lxxii. does it clearly appear
how &quot;blessing oneself in&quot; is connected with &quot;being blessed by.&quot; The very same people
who bless themselves in the glorious King to come, hasten to Him to partake in the
fulness of the blessings which He dispenses. He has dominion from sea to sea; they
that dwell in the wilderness bow before Him; all kings worship Him; all nations
serve Him.</p>
<p class="normal">Several commentators (<i>Clericus</i>, <i>Gesenius</i>, <i>de
Wette</i>, <i>Maurer</i>, <i>Knobel</i>, and, in substance, <i>Hofmann</i> also)
attempt to explain the fundamental passage by the derived ones, and force upon Niphal
the signification of Hithpael; so that the sense would be only that a great and,
as it were, proverbial happiness and prosperity belonged to Abraham: &quot;Holding up
this name as a pattern, most of the eastern nations will comprehend all blessings
in these or similar words: &#39;God bless thee as He blessed Abraham.&#39;&quot; But this explanation
is, according to the <i>usus loquendi</i>, incorrect, inasmuch as the Niphal is
used only in the signification &quot;to be blessed,&quot; and never means &quot;to bless oneself,&quot;
or &quot;to have or find one&#39;s blessing in something.&quot; To a difference in the significations
of the Niphal and the Hithpael, we are led also by the circumstance that the Hithpael
is connected only with the seed&mdash;&quot;they shall bless themselves in thy seed,&quot;&mdash;and the
Niphal only with the person of the Patriarch: <span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
&quot;they shall be blessed in thee,&quot; and &quot;in thee and thy seed.&quot; The Patriarchs themselves
are the source of blessing, but, if these nations <i>blessed themselves</i>, they
wish for themselves the blessing of their descendants exhibited before their eyes.
The reference in Zech. xiv. 17, 18 to the promise made to the Patriarchs presupposes
the Messianic character, and the passive signification of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;</span>. In like manner, all the quotations
of it in the New Testament rest on the passive signification. It is from this view
of it that the Lord says that Abraham saw His day; that, in Rom. iv. 13, Paul finds,
in this promise, the prophecy of His conquering the world; and that, in Gal. iii.
14, he speaks of the blessing of Abraham upon the Gentiles through Christ Jesus.
Gal. iii. 8 and Acts iii. 25 render <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;</span>
by <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>. The explanation, &quot;they
shall wish prosperity or happiness to each other,&quot; is destructive of the gradation,
so evident in the fundamental passage,&mdash;blessing <i>for</i>, <i>on account of</i>,
and <i>by</i> Abraham; it cannot account for the constant, solemn repetition of
this proclamation which everywhere appears as the <i>acme</i> of the promises given
to the Patriarch; it destroys the correspondence existing between this blessing
upon all the families of the earth, and the curse which, after the fall, was inflicted
upon the earth; it does away with the contrast, so clearly marked, between the union
of the families of the earth effected by the blessing, and their dispersion, narrated
in chap. xi.; it demolishes the connection existing between the prophecy of Japheth&#39;s
dwelling in the tents of Shem (ix. 27), on the one hand, and the Ruler proceeding
from Judah, to whom shall be the obedience of the nations (xlix. 10), on the other;
and it severs all the necessary connecting links which unite these prophecies with
one another.</p>
<p class="normal">Another attempt to deprive this promise of its Messianic character&mdash;that,
namely, made by <i>Bertholdt</i> (<i>de ortu theol. Vet. Hebr.</i> p. 102) and others,
who would have us to understand, by the families and nations of the earth, the Canaanitish
nations&mdash;does not require any minute examination, as the weakness of these productions
of rationalistic tendency are so glaringly manifest.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_57" href="#div2Ref_57">THE BLESSING OF JACOB UPON JUDAH</a></h2>
<h3>(Gen. xlix. 8-10.)</h3>
<p class="normal">Ver. 8. &quot;<i>Judah, thou, thy brethren shall praise thee; thy hand
shall be on the neck of thine enemies; before thee shall bow down the sons of thy
father.</i> Ver. 9. <i>A lion&#39;s whelp is Judah; from the prey, my son, thou goest
up; he stoopeth down, he coucheth as a lion, and as a full-grown lion, who shall
rouse him up?</i> Ver. 10. <i>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor lawgiver
from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and unto Him the people shall adhere.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Thus does dying Jacob, in announcing &quot;what shall befall his sons
in the end of the days&quot; (ver. 1), speak to Judah, after having dismissed those of
his sons to whom, in the name of the Lord, he must tell hard things&mdash;things which
did not, however, exclude them from the salvation common to all of them (ver. 28),
although their shadow made the light of Judah shine so much the more brightly.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_57a" href="#ftn_57a">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">In ver. 8 everything depends upon a right determination of the
meaning of the name Judah. Being formed from the Future in Hophal, it signifies:
&quot;He (viz., God) shall be praised.&quot; This explanation rests upon Gen. xxix. 35, where
Leah, after the birth of Judah, says, &quot;Now will I praise the Lord;&quot; and then follow
the words: &quot;therefore she called his name Judah.&quot; It rests likewise on the common
use of the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;</span>, the Hiphil of which is,
according to <i>Maurer</i>, almost constantly used of &quot;praising God,&quot; and is, as
it were, set apart and sanctified for that purpose. After having enumerated a multitude
of passages, <i>Gesenius</i> says, in his <i>Thesaurus</i>: &quot;In all these passages
it refers <span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span> to the praise of God, and it is only
rarely (Gen. xlix. 8 compared with Job xl. 14) that it refers to the praise of men.&quot;
Even these few exceptions are such only in appearance. In Job xl. 14, he whom God
will praise is not an ordinary man, but a <i>god-man</i>. By the subsequent words
in Gen. xlix. 8, &quot;Before thee shall bow down,&quot; something divine is ascribed to Judah;
we need not therefore be astonished that, by the word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1498;</span>, he is raised above the merely human
standing. They only who do not know the Lion of the tribe of Judah, have any reason
to explain away, by a forced exposition, the slight allusion to a superhuman dignity
of the tribe of Judah. The greater number of expositors, referring to the subsequent
words, &quot;thy brethren shall praise thee,&quot; explain the name by the expression, &quot;blessed
one.&quot; But, even though we should retain the sure explanation which has been given
above, the idea now mentioned falls very naturally in with it. He who, in the fullest
sense, is a &quot;God&#39;s-praise&quot; (<i>Gottlob</i>), whose very existence becomes the cause
of exclaiming, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945; &#964;&#8183; &#920;&#949;&#8183;</span>, praise be to God,
will assuredly receive praise from the brethren.&mdash;&quot;Judah thou&quot; stands (according
to Gen. xxvii. 36; Matt. xvi. 18) either for, &quot;Thou art Judah,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, thou
art rightly called so, or, according to Gen. xxiv. 60, for, &quot;Thou Judah,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>,
I have something particular to tell thee (compare the emphatic &quot;I&quot; in Gen. xxiv.
27).&mdash;On the expression, &quot;Thine hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>,
thou shalt put to flight all thine enemies, and press them hard while they are fleeing,
compare Exod. xxiii. 27, &quot;I will make all thine enemies (turn their) backs unto
thee,&quot; and Ps. xviii. 41, where David says, in the name of his family, in which
Judah centred, as did Israel in Judah, &quot;Thou hast given me mine enemies (to be)
a back.&quot; If, however, we inquire how this prophecy was fulfilled, we must not overlook
the circumstance that the subjects of it are sinful men, and that, for this reason,
God could never give up the right of visiting their iniquity,&mdash;a right which has
its foundation in His very nature. Three sentences of condemnation precede the blessing
upon Judah, and this indicates that Judah too will be weighed in the balance of
justice. &quot;The excellency of dignity and the excellency of power,&quot; which, in ver.
3, were taken from Reuben, are here adjudged to Judah. The circumstance of his being
the first-born could not protect the former against the loss of his privileges;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span> and just as little will the divine election
deliver Judah from a visitation for his sins, although, by that election, the total
loss of his privileges is rendered impossible. These two ordinations&mdash;the election
and the visitation of sin in the elect&mdash;stand by the side of each other; and the
latter could not be stayed, even at the time when Judah had reached its height in
the Lion from out of his tribe; for although the Shepherd was blameless, yet the
flock was not so. The ordination of election is, however, far from being thereby
darkened; it only shines by a brighter light. Often painful indeed were the defeats
which Judah had to sustain; often enough&mdash;as during the centuries which elapsed between
the destruction of David&#39;s kingdom and the coming of Christ&mdash;was the promise, &quot;Thy
hand shall be in the necks of thine enemies,&quot; reversed. But when we behold Judah
ever and anon returning and rising to the dignity here bestowed upon him,&mdash;when the
advance then always keeps equal pace with the preceding depths of humiliation (we
need think only of David&#39;s time, and compare it with the period of the Judges),&mdash;then
indeed it appears all the more clearly, that the hand of God is ever active in bringing
this promise to a sure and firm fulfilment. In the history of the world there is
only one power&mdash;that of Judah&mdash;in which, notwithstanding all defeats, the promise,
&quot;Thy hand shall be in the necks of thine enemies,&quot; is ever, after all, fulfilled
anew; only one power, the victorious energy of which may indeed be overcome by sleep,
but never by death; only one power which can speak as does David in the name of
his family in Ps. xviii. 38-40: &quot;I pursue mine enemies and overtake them, I do not
return till they are consumed; I crush them, and they cannot rise: they fall under
my feet. And Thou girdest me with strength for the war, Thou bowest down those that
rise against me.&quot;&mdash;Luther remarks on this passage: &quot;These promises must be understood
in spirit and faith. This may be seen from the history of David, where it often
appears as if God had altogether forgotten him, and what He had promised to him.
After he had already been elected, he was, for ten years, not able to obtain a fixed
place, or residence in the whole kingdom; and when at last he took hold of the reins
of government, he fell into great, grievous, heinous sin, and was sore vexed when
he had to bear the punishment of it. Therefore these two things&mdash;promise and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span> faith&mdash;must always be combined; and it is necessary
that a man who has a divine promise know well the art which Paul teaches in Rom.
iv. 18, to believe in hope even against hope.&mdash;The kingdom of Israel, too, was assailed
by so great weakness, and pressed down by so many burdens, that it appeared as if
every moment it would fall; and this was especially the case when sin, and punishment
in consequence of sin, broke in upon them, as, for instance, after David&#39;s adultery
with Bathsheba, and oftentimes besides. Yet, even in all such temptations, it always
remains, on account of the promise.&quot;&mdash;It must be carefully observed that the words,
&quot;Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies,&quot; are placed between, &quot;Thy brethren
shall praise thee,&quot; and &quot;Before thee shall bow down the sons of thy father,&quot; and
that, immediately after this, Judah&#39;s victorious power against the enemies of God&#39;s
people is again pointed out. This teaches us that the exalted position which Judah,
when compared with his brethren, occupies, rests mainly on this:&mdash;that he is their
fore-champion in the warfare against the world, and that God has endowed him with
conquering power against the enemies of His kingdom. The history of David is best
calculated to show and convince us, how closely these two things are connected with
each other. That he was called to verify the truth of the promise given to Judah,
&quot;Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies,&quot; was first seen in his victory
over Goliath the Philistine, fore-champion of the world&#39;s power. After David&#39;s word
had been fulfilled, &quot;The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out
of the paw of the bear. He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine,&quot;
and the Philistines had fled, seeing that their champion was dead (1 Sam. xvii.
37-51), then also were fulfilled the other words: &quot;Thy brethren shall praise thee,
the sons of thy father shall bow before thee.&quot; &quot;And it came to pass as they came,
when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came
out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tabrets,
with joy, and with instruments of music. And the women answered one another as they
played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.&quot;&mdash;And
in Sam. xviii. 16, it is said: &quot;But all Israel and Judah <i>loved</i> David, <i>
because</i> he went out and came in before them;&quot;&mdash;and in 2 Sam. v. 2, when the ten
tribes acknowledged <span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span> David as their king, they
said: &quot;Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest
out and broughtest in Israel.&quot; David would never have succeeded in overcoming the
jealousy and envy of the other tribes, unless the promise, &quot;Thy hand shall be in
the neck of thine enemies,&quot; had been fulfilled in him.&mdash;<i>Before Judah shall how
down the sons of his father.</i> I have already remarked, in my commentary on Rev.
xix. 10, that there is very little ground for the common distinction between religious
and civil <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> (bowing down, worship).
The true distinction is between that <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>
which is given to God, either directly or indirectly, in those who bear His image,
in the representatives of His gifts and offices,&mdash;and that
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> which is exacted apart from, and
against God. &quot;The God of Scripture demands to be honoured in those who bear His
image, who hold His offices,&mdash;in father and mother and old men (Lev. xix. 32), in
princes (Exod. xxii. 28), in the office of the judge (Deut. i. 17; Exod. xxi. 6,
xxii. 7, 8). It is wicked to refuse this honour, and its natural expression in the
bowing of the body, under the pretext, that it is due to <i>God</i> alone. It is
to be refused only where there is some danger that, thereby, any independent honour
would be ascribed to the mere vessel of the divine glory.&quot; In what the
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> consists, which Judah is to receive
from his brethren, we see distinctly from Isa. xlv. 14, where the heathen, at the
time of the salvation, fall down before Israel: &quot;Thus saith the Lord, The labour
of Egypt and merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come
over unto thee, and be thine: they shall go behind thee; in chains they shall walk;
<i>and they shall fall down before thee, and they shall make supplication unto thee</i>
(saying). <i>Only in thee is God, and there is no God else.</i>&quot; The ground of Judah&#39;s
adoration on the part of his brethren is this:&mdash;that God&#39;s glory is visibly upon
him, that by glorious deeds and victories the seal is impressed upon him: &quot;with
us is God&quot; (<i>Immanuel</i>). And this found its most glorious fulfilment in the
Lion of the tribe of Judah, in Christ, of whom it is said in Phil. ii. 9-11: &quot;Wherefore
God has highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name; that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of all those who are in heaven, and
on earth, and under the earth; and that every tongue should
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span> confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, to the
glory of God the Father.&quot; That, in its final accomplishment, this prophecy referred
to Christ, was known to Jacob as certainly as he makes Judah centre in the Shiloh.
This Solomon also knew, when, in Ps. lxxii. 11 (compare Ps. xlv. 12), he ascribes
to his great Antitype what is here ascribed to Judah: &quot;All kings shall worship Him,
and all nations shall serve Him.&quot; The consequence of the worship &quot;by kings and nations&quot;
is the worshipping &quot;by the sons of the father.&quot; Jacob thus transfers to Judah that
which Isaac had promised to <i>him</i>: &quot;People shall serve thee, and nations shall
worship thee: be lord over thy brethren, and thy mother&#39;s sons shall worship before
thee:&quot; Gen. xxvii. 29.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">In ver. 9 Judah is first designated a young lion,&mdash;a
name which is intended to indicate, that the victorious power ascribed to Judah
exists, as yet, only in the <i>germ</i>. It required that centuries should pass
away before he grew up to be a lion, a full-grown lion. By the long period which
thus intervened between the promise and its fulfilment, the divine election is the
more strikingly manifested. (Several interpreters have been of opinion that there
is no difference between the young lion, the lion, and the full-grown lion. But
it is shown by Ezek. xix. 3&mdash;&quot;And she brought up one of her
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, and it became a
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, and it learnt to tear prey,&quot;&mdash;that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;</span> is a young lion not yet able to catch
prey.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_62a" href="#ftn_62a">[2]</a></sup>) In
the words, &quot;From the prey, my son, thou art gone up,&quot; the <i>prey</i> is the <i>
terminus a quo</i>: for <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;</span> with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span> is always used of the place from which
it is gone up (see Josh. iv. 17, x. 9; Song of Sol. iv. 2): the <i>terminus ad quem</i>
is the usual abode, as is shown by what follows. The residence of the conqueror
and ruler is conceived of as being <i>elevated</i>. Joseph, according to Gen. xlvi.
31, goes up to Pharaoh, and in ver. 29 of the same chapter he goes up to meet his
father. The expression &quot;to go up&quot; is commonly used of those who come from
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span> other countries to Canaan. But the &quot;going up&quot;
in the passage under review implies also the &quot;going down&quot; into the lower regions
to seek for prey, just as in Ps. lxviii. 19, where it is said of the Lord, after
He had fought for His people, and had been victorious, &quot;Thou hast ascended on high,
Thou hast led captivity captive: Thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the
rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.&quot; &quot;<i>To dwell</i>&quot; means
there, that, after having accomplished all this, thou mayest dwell gloriously, and
be inaccessible to the vengeance of the conquered, in thy usual place of abode.
The sense is the same in the passage before us. Luther is therefore wrong in explaining
it thus: &quot;Thou hast risen high, my son, by great victories,&quot;&mdash;as are others also
who translate it, &quot;From the prey thou growest up.&quot; Such a view of this clause would,
moreover, break up the connection, and all that follows would appear without preparation.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_63a" href="#ftn_63a">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;He stoopeth down, he croucheth as a lion, and as a
full-grown lion; who shall rouse him up?&quot; contain a transition and allusion to what
we are subsequently told concerning Shiloh. Even here we are presented with a picture
of peace,&mdash;a peace, however, which is not to the prejudice of victorious power, as
in the case of Issachar (vers. 14, 15), but which, on the contrary, preserves it
undiminished. If the promise, &quot;From the prey, my son, thou art gone up,&quot; found its
first glorious, although only preliminary, fulfilment in the reign of David (compare
the enumeration of his victories in 2 Sam. viii.), the words, &quot;He stoopeth down,
he coucheth,&quot; etc., are the most appropriate inscription for the portal of Solomon&#39;s
reign. But, in Christ, the pre-eminence in the reign both of war and peace is united.&mdash;That
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;</span> is not &quot;the lioness,&quot; but only the poetical
designation of the lion, appears from just the very passage which is so commonly
adduced in support of the former signification, viz., Job iv. 11; for the sons of
the lion spoken of in that passage are the sons of the wicked (compare Job xxvii.
14).</p>
<p class="normal">A parallel to the words in ver. 10, &quot;The sceptre shall not depart
from Judah,&quot; is formed by the departing of the sceptre from Egypt, in Zech. x. 11:
&quot;And the pride of Assyria shall <span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span> be brought
down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.&quot; All dominion of the world over
the people of God is only temporary; and so also, the dominion of the people of
God over the world, as it centres in Judah, can sustain only a temporary <i>interruption</i>:
its departure is everywhere in appearance only; and when it departs, it is only
that it may return with enhanced weight.&mdash;The <i>sceptre</i> is the emblem of dominion.
The words, &quot;A sceptre rises out of Israel&quot; (Num. xxiv. 17), are explained in chap.
xxiv. 19 by the words, &quot;<i>Dominion</i> shall come out of Jacob.&quot; The question as
to the subjects of this dominion must be determined from the preceding words; for
there shall not depart from Judah what Judah, according to these words, possesses.
Hence they are (1) the brethren of Judah, and (2) the enemies of Israel. The latter
can the less properly be excluded, because of these alone the whole of the preceding
verse treated. In the words of Balaam, in Num. xxiv. 17 (which refer to the passage
under consideration), &quot;There cometh a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre riseth out
of Israel, and smiteth the territories of Moab, and destroyeth all the sons of the
tumult,&quot; there is viewed, in the sceptre, only the victorious and destructive power
which he shall display in his relation to the <i>world</i>; but the subjects of
dominion are, in that passage, according to ver. 19, the heathens also. The sceptre
is pre-eminently an ensign of kings. Hence, to the sceptre and star out of Israel
(Num. xxiv. 17) corresponds, in ver. 7, his <i>king</i>: &quot;And his king shall be
higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted,&quot;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not merely a single
royal person, but the Israelitish kingdom. But we can here the less legitimately
separate sceptre and kingdom from each other, because, even in the earlier promises
made to the Patriarch, there is the prophecy of the rising of a kingdom among their
descendants,&mdash;of a kingdom, too, that shall extend beyond the boundary of that posterity
itself. (Compare Gen. xvii. 6, &quot;Kings shall come out of thee;&quot; ver. 16, &quot;And she
shall become nations. Icings of nations shall be of her.&quot; See also Gen. xxxv. 11.)
In vol. ii. of the <i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>, p.
166 f., we detailed the natural foundations which there existed for foreseeing the
establishment of a kingdom in Israel. It is evident that the promise which was formally
given to the whole posterity of the Patriarchs, is here appropriated specially to
Judah, who, for <span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span> the benefit of the whole people,
is to have the sceptre.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_65a" href="#ftn_65a">[4]</a></sup>
From what has been remarked, it appears that the fulfilment of this prophecy began
first with David; up to that time Judah had been only &quot;a lion&#39;s whelp.&quot; &quot;In the
person of Saul,&quot; as Calvin remarks, &quot;there was an abortive effort; but there came
out at length in David, under the authority and legitimate arrangement of God, the
sovereignty of Judah, according to the prophecy of Jacob.&quot; It also appears, from
what has been observed, that <i>Reinke</i>, S. 45 of his Monography, <i>Die Weissagung
Jacobs über Schilo</i>, Münster 1849 (a work written with great diligence), is mistaken
in determining the sense to be,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_65b" href="#ftn_65b">[5]</a></sup>
that Judah as a tribe would not perish, and his superiority not cease, until out
of him Shiloh, etc.; and that he is wrong, too, in maintaining, S. 133, that the
continuance of the royal dignity, and the superiority over all the tribes until
the time of Christ, were not required by these words. From the remarks which we
have made, even more than that is required,&mdash;the <i>continuance</i>, namely, <i>of
Judah&#39;s dominion over the Gentiles</i>; for otherwise it would be necessary to make
a violent separation of these words from the preceding ones. That which has given
rise to such interpretations and assertions, viz., the apparent difficulty encountered
in pointing out the fulfilment,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_65c" href="#ftn_65c">[6]</a></sup>
is by no means removed by such an explanation. For, if we look to the surface only,
what had been left of the superiority of the tribe of Judah, at the time when Christ
appeared? But if we look deeper, we shall find no reason for such feeble interpretations.
The fulness of strength which, notwithstanding the deepest humiliation, still dwelt
in the sceptre of Judah at the time when Christ appeared, is made manifest by the
very appearance of Christ&mdash;the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Although faint-heartedness,
perceiving only what is immediately before the eyes, might have said, &quot;The sceptre
has departed from <span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span> Judah,&quot; to every one who
was not blinded it must have been evident, at the very moment when Christ appeared,
that the sceptre had not departed from Judah. We must not allow ourselves to be
perplexed by any events and arguments adduced to prove that the sceptre <i>has departed</i>
from Judah; for the very same events and arguments would militate against the eternal
dominion of his house which had been promised to David, and would therefore make
us doubtful of that also. All these events and arguments lose their significancy,
when we remark, that this departing is only an <i>apparent</i>, not a <i>definitive</i>
one;&mdash;that God never, by His promises, binds the hands of His punitive justice;&mdash;that
His election goes always hand-in-hand with the visitation of the sins of the elected;
but that, in the end, the election will stand in all its validity.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_66a" href="#ftn_66a">[1]</a></sup>
To Judah applies exactly what in Ps. lxxxix. 31-35 is said of David: &quot;If his children
forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments; if they break My statutes, and keep
not My commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, My loving-kindness will I not utterly take
from him, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor
alter the thing that is gone out of My lips.&quot; But the greater the degradation that
had come upon Judah, the more consoling is this promise. If we see that neither
the decline of David&#39;s and Judah&#39;s dominion after Solomon, nor the apparently total
disappearance of David&#39;s kingdom which took place after the Chaldee catastrophe,
and continued for centuries; nor the altogether comfortless condition (when
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span> looking only at what Is visible) which Jeremiah
describes in the words: &quot;Judah is captive in affliction and great servitude: she
dwelleth among the heathen, and findeth no rest. The anointed of the Lord, who was
our consolation, is taken in their pits, he of whom we said, Under his shadow we
shall live among the heathen. Slaves are ruling over us, and there is none to deliver
us from their hand;&quot;&mdash;if we see that all these things did not prevent the fulfilment
of the words, &quot;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come;&quot;&mdash;that,
notwithstanding all these things, it most gloriously manifested itself in the appearance
of Christ, that the dominion remained still with Judah;&mdash;why should we be dismayed
though the river of the kingdom of God should sometimes lose itself in the sand?
Why should we not be firmly confident that in due time it shall spring forth again
with its clear and powerful waters?&mdash;But the <i>Jews</i> are not benefited by this
distinction betwixt the <i>definitive</i> departing of the sceptre, and one which
is merely <i>temporary</i>. The latter must necessarily be distinguished from the
former by this:&mdash;that even in the times of abasement, there must be single symptoms
which still indicate the continuance of the sceptre; and this was evidently the
case in the times before Christ. In Jehoshaphat, Uzziah, and Hezekiah, the sceptre
of Judah brought forth new leaves; after their return from the captivity, the place,
at least, was pointed out by Zerubbabel, which the Davidic kingdom would, at some
future period, again occupy. The victories of the times of the Maccabees, though
they themselves were not of the tribe of Judah, served to manifest clearly that
the lion&#39;s strength and the lion&#39;s courage had not yet departed from Judah. It is
not without significance that <i>Judas Maccabeus</i> had his name thus. And under
all these events the family of David always remained distinct, and capable of being
traced out. But nothing of all this is to be found with the Jews during the 1800
years after Christ; and hence the vanity of their hope that, in some future time,
it will be made evident by the appearance of Shiloh, that the supremacy and dominion
of Judah are not lost.</p>
<p class="normal">Along with the <i>sceptre</i> which shall not depart from Judah,
the <i>lawgiver</i> is mentioned, for whom many would, quite arbitrarily, substitute
the <i>commander&#39;s staff</i>. Is. xxxiii. 22 is explanatory of this passage; &quot;For
the Lord our Judge, the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span> Lord our Lawgiver,
the Lord our King, He will save us&quot;&mdash;where the <i>lawgiver</i> is put on a level
with the <i>judge</i> and <i>king</i>. Gesenius translates it by: our <i>commander</i>.</p>
<p class="normal">The lawgiver shall not depart &quot;from between his feet.&quot; This is
a poetical expression for &quot;from him.&quot; He is, as it were, to have the lawgiver wherever
he moves or stands. Explanatory of this is the passage in Judges v. 27, where, in
the Song of Deborah, it is said of Jael, &quot;He bowed between her feet, he fell, he
lay down.&quot; That which any one has between his feet, is accordingly his territory
on which he moves, that within his reach. In the latter passage the prose expression
would have been, &quot;beside her,&quot; and in the passage under consideration, &quot;from him.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_68a" href="#ftn_68a">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">Sceptre and lawgiver shall not depart from Judah until
Shiloh come. Here everything depends upon fixing the derivation and signification
of this word. There cannot be any doubt, and, indeed, it is now almost universally
admitted, that it is derived from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, &quot;to
rest.&quot; In the first edition of this work, the author gave it as his opinion, that
its formation was analogous to that of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;</span>,
&quot;tumult of war,&quot; from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1491;&#1512;</span>, &quot;to be troubled,&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1497;&#1496;&#1512;</span>, &quot;smoke,&quot; from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463; ,&#1511;&#1496;&#1512;</span> from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1495;</span>; and many (<i>Hofmann</i>, <i>Kurtz</i>,
<i>Reinke</i>) have stedfastly maintained this opinion even until now. But the author
must confess that the objections raised against this derivation by <i>Tuch</i> are
well-founded. &quot;In the first place,&quot; <i>Tuch</i> remarks, &quot;it is well known that
forms like <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1497;&#1496;&#1512;</span> do not constitute any special
class in the etymology, but have originated from <i>Piel</i> forms (<i>Ewald</i>,
Lehrb. d. Hebr. Spr. § 156 b), as is very clearly shown by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;</span>, being found by the side of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span>. But the <i>o</i> in the final syllable
of these words is not an o unchangeable, according to the rules of etymology, and
could, therefore, not remain in a root <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1495;</span>;
<i>and there is not found, in general, any form of a root</i>
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1495;</span> <i>analogous to</i>
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1497;&#1496;&#1512;</span>.&quot; But far more decisive is another reason.
&quot;The <i>nomina Gentilia</i> <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;</span> (2 Sam.
xv. 12), <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;</span> (1 Kings
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span> xi. 29, xii. 15), lead us from the supposed
form to the substantive termination <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> which
a <i>liquida</i> may drop, and express the remaining vowel
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;</span> by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;</span>.&quot;
(Compare <i>Ewald</i>, § 163.) Now that <i>Shiloh</i> is an abbreviation of <i>Shilon</i>
is proved, not only by the <i>nomen gentile</i>, but also by the fact, that the
ruins of the town which received its name from the Shiloh in our passage, are, up
to the present moment, called <i>Seilun</i>, and that Josephus writes <i>Silo</i>
as well as <i>Silun</i>, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#931;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> (compare <i>
Robinson</i>, Travels iii. 1, p. 305); and, <i>finally</i>, by the analogy of the
name <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span>, which is formed after the manner
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, and likewise shortened from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;</span>. We must confess that <i>Tuch</i> is
right also when he asserts: &quot;That it is quite impossible to give the word the signification
of an appellative noun, since it is only in proper names, in which the signification
of the suffix of derivation is of less consequence, that <i>on</i> is shortened
into <i>o</i>.&quot; The only exception is that of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492;</span>,
&quot;hell,&quot; in Prov. xxvii. 20; but even this is only an <i>apparent</i> exception,
and is quite in accordance with the rule laid down, inasmuch as &quot;hell&quot; is, in this
passage, personified,&mdash;as is frequently the case in other passages. (Compare Rev.
ix. 11.) But this case very plainly shows that we are not at liberty to apply, as
<i>Tuch</i> does, the measure of our proper names to those of Scripture, which are
used in a more comprehensive sense. The Samaritan translation is, therefore, right
in retaining the &quot;Shiloh.&quot; As the passage under review is the first in which the
person of the Redeemer meets us, so Shiloh is also the first <i>name</i> of the
Redeemer,&mdash;a name expressive of His nature, and quite in correspondence with the
names in Is. ix. 5, and with the name Immanuel in Is. vii. 14. With respect to the
<i>signification</i> of the name, the termination <i>on</i>, according to <i>Ewald</i>,
§ 163, forms adjectives and abstract nouns. The analogy of the name
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span>, which is formed after the manner of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, indicates that it has here <i>an adjective</i>
signification, and, like Solomon, Shiloh denotes &quot;the man of rest,&quot; corresponds
to the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; in Is. ix. 5, and, viewed in its character of a proper
name, is like the German &quot;<i>Friedrich</i>&quot; = Frederick, <i>i.e.</i>, &quot;rich in peace,&quot;
&quot;the Peaceful one.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">To Shiloh the nations shall adhere. The word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;</span> is commonly understood as meaning &quot;obedience.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_69a" href="#ftn_69a">[9]</a></sup>
But it does not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span> denote every kind of obedience,
but only that which is spontaneous, and has its root in piety. This is clearly shown
by the only passage in which, besides the one under consideration, the word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;</span> is found, Prov. xxx. 17: &quot;An eye that
mocketh at his father, and despises the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;</span>
of his mother.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_70a" href="#ftn_70a">[10]</a></sup>
To this view we are led also by the Arabic, where the word
<img border="0" alt="[Arabic: **]" src="images/image70a.png" height="25" width="25">,
does not denote obedience in general, but willing obedience, docility, in the viii.
sq. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span> <i>dicto audientem se præbuit more discipuli</i>.
(Compare <i>Camus</i> in <i>Schulten</i>, on Prov. l. c.) Cognate is
<img border="0" alt="[Arabic: **]" src="images/image70b.png" height="32" width="25">,
&quot;to take care,&quot; &quot;to guard oneself,&quot; specially of the conflict with the higher powers
of life, in the viii. <i>semet custodivit ah aliqua re, et absolute timuit coluitque
Deum, pius fuit.</i> From it is derived <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;</span>
<i>pius</i> in Prov. xxx. 1, where the son of Jakeh speaks to &quot;With me is God, and
I prevail&quot; (<i>Heb.</i> Itheal and Ucal.)</p>
<p class="normal">Luther, although he has misunderstood the right meaning of Shiloh,
has yet beautifully comprehended the sense of the whole passage. &quot;This is a golden
text,&quot; he says, &quot;and well worthy of remembrance, namely: that the kingdom of Christ
will not be such a kingdom as that of David was, of whom it is said, 1 Chron. xxviii.
3, that he was a man of war and had shed much blood. The kingdom of Shiloh, which
succeeded it, is not a kingdom so powerful and bloody, but consists in this,&mdash;that
the word, by which it is ruled or administered, is heard, believed, and obeyed.
All will be done by means of preaching; and this will just be the sign by which
the kingdom of Christ is distinguished from the other kingdoms of this world, which
are governed by the sword and by physical power.&quot; To this point also Luther draws
attention, that our prophecy affords a powerful support to the ministers of the
Word: &quot;It will be done by the proclamation of the promise, and Shiloh will be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span> present with it, and will be efficient and
powerful through our tongue and mouth.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">That by the <i>nations</i> are not meant either the Canaanites
in particular, or the tribes of Israel, but the nations in general, appears, partly,
from the connection with what precedes&mdash;those who now willingly obey are evidently
the enemies spoken of in vers. 8, 9,&mdash;and, partly, from the reference to the earlier
promises of Genesis, all of which refer to nations in general. If a limitation had
been intended, an express indication of it would have been necessary. The analogy
of the parallel Messianic passages likewise militates against such a limitation;
<i>e.g.</i>, Ps. lxxii. 8: &quot;He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the
river unto the ends of the earth.&quot; (Compare also Is. xi. 10.)</p>
<p class="normal">In the Shiloh, the whole dignity of Judah as Lord and Ruler is
to be concentrated. It hence follows, that the nations who will not willingly obey
Him as Shiloh, must experience the destructive power of His sceptre (Num. xxiv.
17; Ps. ii. 9), and that behind the attractive kingdom of peace, there is concealed
the destructive dominion of the lion.</p>
<p class="normal">Several interpreters have determined the sense as follows:&mdash;The
dominion of Judah should continue until the appearing of Shiloh; but that then he
should lose it.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_71a" href="#ftn_71a">[11]</a></sup>
We, on the contrary, conceive the sense to be this: &quot;That the tribe of Judah should
not lose the dominion until he attain to its highest realization by Shiloh, who
should be descended from him, and to whom all the nations of the earth should render
obedience.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">Against this interpretation no difficulty can be raised
from the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1497;</span>. It is true that this term
has always a reference to the <i>terminus ad quem</i> only, and includes it; but
it is as certain that, very frequently, a <i>terminus ad quem</i> is mentioned which
is not intended to be the last, but only one of special importance; so that what
lies beyond it is lost sight of. (Compare the author&#39;s <i>Dissert. on the Genuin.
of Daniel</i>, pp. 55-56.) If <span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span> only sceptre
and lawgiver were secured to Judah up to the time of Shiloh&#39;s coming, then, as a
matter of course, they were so afterwards. That, previous to the coming of Shiloh,
great dangers would threaten the sceptre of Judah, is indicated by Jacob, since
he lays so much stress upon the sceptre&#39;s not departing until that time. <i>Hence
we expect circumstances that will almost amount to a departing of the sceptre.</i></p>
<p class="normal">But the positive reason for this interpretation is, that if, according
to the other opinion, Judah were told that the dominion of his tribe were, at some
future period, to cease, this would not be in harmony with the tone of the remainder
of the address to Judah, which is altogether of a cheerful character. And <i>then</i>,&mdash;Jacob
would, in that case, not have allowed the Messianic promise to remain in its indefinite
state; from former analogies, we should have been induced to expect that he would
transfer it to one of his sons. And <i>finally</i>,&mdash;from the analogy of the other
Messianic prophecies, as well as from history, it seems not to be admissible to
contrast the dominion of Judah with the kingdom of the Messiah. The dominion of
Judah does not by any means <i>terminate</i> in Christ; it rather <i>centres</i>
in Him.</p>
<p class="normal">We are not expressly told that the Shiloh will be descended from
Judah; but this is supposed to be self-evident, and is not, therefore, expressly
mentioned. If it were otherwise, the Shiloh would not have been alluded to in connection
with Judah at all. A restriction of the promise to Judah, such as would take place
if the Shiloh did not belong to him, is the less legitimate, inasmuch as, in vers.
8, 9, victory and dominion, without any limitation, are promised to Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">Having thus adduced the positive arguments in support of our view
of this passage, let us now further examine the opinions of those who differ from
us. Here, then, we must first of all consider those which are at one with us in
the acknowledgment that this passage contains the promise of a personal Messiah.</p>
<p class="normal">1. Some interpreters (<i>Jonathan</i>, <i>Luther</i>, <i>Calvin</i>,
<i>Knapp</i>, <i>Dogm.</i>) are of opinion that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span>
is compounded of the noun <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;</span>, &quot;child,&quot; and
the suffix of the third person: &quot;Until his (<i>i.e.</i>, Judah&#39;s) son or descendant,
the Messiah, shall come.&quot; (Luther, somewhat differently.) But this supposed signification
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
is destitute of any tenable foundation. That by such an explanation, moreover, there
is a dissolution of the connection betwixt the Shiloh in this passage, and Shiloh
the name of a place, which is written in precisely the same manner, is decisive
against both the view just given forth and that which follows.</p>
<p class="normal">2. Others (the last of them. <i>Sack</i> in the second edition
of his <i>Apolog.</i>) suppose the word to be erroneously pointed. They propose
to read <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</span>, compounded of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;</span> for <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;</span>,
and the suffix <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;</span> for
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;</span>. They suppose the language to be elliptical:
&quot;Until He come to whom the dominion or sceptre belongs, or is due.&quot; The principal
argument in support of this exposition is, that most of the ancient translators
seem to have followed this punctuation. It is true that this is doubtful as regards
<i>Onkelos</i> and the <i>Targum</i> of Jerusalem, which translate, &quot;<i>Donec veniat
Messias, cujus est regnum</i>;&quot; for we may well suppose that here
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span> is simply rendered by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488;</span>, while the following clause adds a complement
from Ezek. xxi. 32, which is founded upon the passage now under review. But it is
certain that the LXX. supposed the punctuation to be
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</span>. They translate:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7957;&#969;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#7956;&#955;&#952;&#8131; &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> (Thus read the
two oldest manuscripts&mdash;the Vatican and Alexandrian. The other reading,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8103; &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, has no doubt crept in from the
later Greek translations, notwithstanding the charge which <i>Justinus</i> [<i>Dial.
c. Tryph.</i> § 120] raises against the Jews, that they had substituted the
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> for the earlier
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8103; &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>. Comp. <i>Stroth</i> in <i>Eichhorn&#39;s</i>
Repert. ii. 95; <i>Hohne&#39;s</i> edition of the LXX.) <i>Aquila</i> and <i>Symmachus</i>,
who translate, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8103; &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, as well as the
Syriac and Saadias, who translate, <i>Ille cujus est</i>, follow the same reading.
But the defenders of this exposition are wrong in inferring, from the circumstance
of the ancient translations having followed this punctuation, that it was generally
received. Had such been the case, how could it be explained that it should no more
be found in any of our manuscripts? For the circumstance that forty manuscripts
collected by <i>de Rossi</i> have <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1492;</span> written
without a <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;</span>, cannot be considered as of great
weight; since it is merely a defective way of writing, occurring frequently in similar
words. But if we consider the fact, which may be established upon historical grounds,
that the Jews watched with most anxious care the uncorrupted preservation of the
received <span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span> text of Holy Scripture, according
to its consonants and pronunciation; that they did not even venture to receive into
the text any emendation, though it should have recommended itself as in the highest
degree probable; while, on the other hand, the ancient Jewish and Christian translators
took great liberties in this respect, and, in the manifold perplexities into which,
owing to their insufficient resources and knowledge, they fell, helped themselves
as best they could;&mdash;it will certainly appear to us most probable, that even the
ancient translators found our vocalization of the word as the received one, but
felt themselves obliged to depart from it, because they could, in accordance with
it, give no suitable derivation; whilst the punctuation adopted by them agreed perfectly
with the traditional reference of the passage to the Messiah. But if this be the
case, the authority of the ancient translations can here be of no greater weight
than that of any modern interpreter; and, in the case under review, we are at liberty
to urge all those considerations which are, in general, advanced against any change
in the vocalization, unless there be most urgent reasons for it. The ancient translators,
moreover, can have less weight with us, because we can distinctly perceive that
a misapprehension of Ezek. xxi. 32 (27)&mdash;on which passage we shall afterwards comment&mdash;gave
rise to their error. Against this explanation it may be further urged, not only
that the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;</span> <i>prefix</i> occurs nowhere else
in the Pentateuch&mdash;an objection which is not in itself sufficient, since it occurs
so early as in the song of Deborah, Judges v. 7&mdash;but also, that the supposed ellipsis
would be exceedingly hard. (Compare <i>Stange</i>, <i>Theol. Symm.</i> i. S. 238
ff.)</p>
<p class="normal">Before we pass on to a consideration of the non-Messianic interpretation,
we shall first state the reasons which bear us out in assuming that the passage
under review contains a prophecy of a personal Messiah.</p>
<p class="normal">It is certainly, with respect to this, a matter of no slight importance
that, with a rare agreement, exegetical tradition finds a promise to this effect
here expressed; and this circumstance has a significance so much the greater, the
less that this agreement extends to the interpretation of the particulars, especially
as regards the Shiloh. How manifold soever these differences may be, <i>all antiquity
agrees in interpreting this passage of a personal Messiah</i>; and we could scarcely<!--1854 -->
conceive of such an agreement, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span> unless there
had been some objective foundation for it. As regards, first, the exegetical tradition
of the Jews,&mdash;how far soever we may follow it, it finds, in ver. 10, the Messiah.
Thus the LXX. explained it; for, that by &quot;what is destined to Judah&quot; (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7957;&#969;&#962;
&#7938;&#957; &#7956;&#955;&#952;&#8131; &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span>) they understood nothing else than the sending
of the Messiah, is shown by the words following&mdash;<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#8055;&#945; &#7952;&#952;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</span>,&mdash;which can refer only to the Messiah. (Compare Is.
xlii. 4 according to the LXX.) In the same manner the passage was understood by
<i>Aquila</i>, the Chaldee Paraphrasts, the <i>Targum</i> of <i>Onkelos</i>, of
<i>Jonathan</i>, and of <i>Jerusalem</i>, the <i>Talmud</i>, the <i>Sohar</i>, and
the ancient book of <i>Breshith Rabba</i>. Several even of the modern commentators,
<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Jarchi</i>, have retained this explanation, although a strong doctrinal
interest, to which others yielded, tempted them to give another interpretation to
this passage, which occupied so prominent a place in the polemics of the Christians.
(Compare the passage in <i>Raim. Martini Pug. Fid.</i> ed. <i>Carpzov</i>; <i>Jac.
Alting&#39;s</i> Shiloh, Franc. 1660, 4to [also in the opp. t. v.]; <i>Schöttgen</i>,
<i>hor. Hebr.</i> ii. p. 146; and, most completely, in &quot;<i>Jac. Patriarch. de Schiloh
vatic. a depravatione Clerici assertum</i>, op. <i>Seb. Edzardi</i>, Londini 1698,
p. 103 sq.&quot;) The Samaritans, too, understood the passage as referring to the Messiah.
(Compare <i>Samarit. Briefwechsel</i>, communicated by <i>Schnurrer</i> in <i>Eichhorn&#39;s
Repert.</i> ix. S. 27.) It is true that from other passages (&quot;<i>Epist. Samarit.
ad Jobum Ludolfum</i>,&quot; in <i>Eichhorn&#39;s Repert.</i> xiii. S. 281-9, compared with
<i>de Sacy</i> &quot;<i>de Vers. Samarit. Arab. Pentateuchi</i> in <i>Eichhorn&#39;s Biblioth.</i>&quot;
x. S. 54) it appears that, in accordance with their doctrine of a double Messiah&mdash;one
who had already appeared, and one who was still to come&mdash;they referred our passage,
partly to the former, and denied its reference to the real Messiah. But this is
of no importance. For, as Gesenius also has remarked (<i>Carmina Samaritana</i>,
p. 75), the doctrine of a double Messiah is of recent origin with the Samaritans
as well as with the Jews; and hence, it is very probable that the reference to the
real Messiah was, formerly, the generally prevailing one, which was, even afterwards,
to a large extent retained, as is shown by the passage first quoted.&mdash;<i>Finally</i>,
In the Christian Church the Messianic interpretation has been the prevailing one
ever since the earliest times. We find it as early as <i>Justin Martyr</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span> The Greek and Latin Fathers agree in it. (Compare
the statements in <i>Reinke</i>.) Even <i>Grotius</i> could not but admit that this
passage referred to the Messiah; and <i>Clericus</i> stands quite alone and isolated,
in his time, as an objector against the Messianic interpretation of it.</p>
<p class="normal">But even in the Canon itself, this passage is understood of a
personal Messiah. David, Solomon, Isaiah, Ezekiel, look upon it in this light. (Concerning
this point, compare the inquiries in the subsequent portions of this work.)</p>
<p class="normal">The entire relation of the Pentateuch to the succeeding sacred
literature, and the circumstance that the former constitutes the foundation of the
latter, and contains, in the germ, all that is afterwards more fully developed,
entitle us to expect, that the Messianic idea has also found its expression in those
books. The more prominent the place occupied, in the later books, by the announcement
of a personal Messiah, the more unlikely it will be to him who has acquired right
fundamental views regarding the Pentateuch, to conceive that this announcement should
be wanting in it&mdash;the announcement, especially, of the Messiah in His kingly office;
for it is this office of the Messiah which, in the Old Testament, generally takes
a prominent place, and is, before all others, represented in the subsequent books.
But there cannot be any doubt, that the promise of a personal Messiah in His kingly
office, if it be found in the Old Testament at all, must exist in the passage which
we are now considering.</p>
<p class="normal">The promises which first were given to Jacob&#39;s parents, and thereafter
transferred to him, included two things:&mdash;<i>first</i>, a numerous progeny, and the
possession of Canaan for them;&mdash;and <i>secondly</i>, the blessing which, through
them, was to come upon all nations. How, then, could it be expected that Jacob,
in transferring these blessings to his sons, and while in spirit seeing them already
in possession of the promised land, and describing the places of abode which they
would occupy, and what should befall them, should have entirely lost sight of the
second object, which was much the more important, and as often repeated? Is it not,
on the contrary, probable that, as formerly, from among the sons of Abraham and
Isaac, so now, from among the sons of Jacob, <i>he</i> should be pointed out who
should, according to the will of God, become the depositary of this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span> promise, which was acquiring more and more
of a definite shape? The contrary of this we can the less imagine, because, according
to ver. 2, Jacob is to tell his sons that which shall befall them &quot;at the end of
the days.&quot; The expression, &quot;the end of the days,&quot; is always used of that only which
lies at the end of the course which is seen by the speaker. (Compare my work on
Balaam,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_77a" href="#ftn_77a">[12]</a></sup> p.
465 f.) Accordingly, it indicates, in this passage, that Jacob&#39;s announcement must
comprehend the whole of the future sphere which was accessible to him. But if we
do not admit the reference, in this passage, to the Messiah, then a whole territory
of future time, notoriously accessible to Jacob, is left untouched by his announcement.&mdash;From
the beginning of Genesis, we find the expectation of an universal salvation; and
at every new separation, the depositary of this salvation, and its mediator for
the whole remaining world, are regularly pointed out. At first, salvation is promised
to the whole human race, then to the family of Shem, then to Abraham, then to Isaac,
then to Jacob. &quot;Now that the patriarchal <i>trias</i>, since Jacob, has extended
into a <i>dodekas</i> forming the historical transition from the family of the promise
to the nation of the promise, the question arises, from which of the twelve tribes
salvation, <i>i.e.</i>, the victory of mankind, and the blessing of the nations,
is to come.&quot; (<i>Delitzsch</i>, <i>Prophetische Theologie</i>, S. 293.) Should Genesis
become to such a degree inconsistent with itself as not to answer a question which
itself has called forth? But that answer is contained in the passage under consideration,
only if Shiloh be taken for the personal name of the Redeemer. Unless we have recourse
to artificial explanations, the announcement of Judah&#39;s being the bearer of salvation
is to be found in our passage, only when, at the same time, the first indication
of the person of the Messiah is perceived in it.</p>
<p class="normal">If the reference of the passage to a personal Messiah be explained
away, we should certainly be at a loss to discover where the fundamental prophecy
of such an one could possibly be found. We should then, in the first place, be thrown
upon the Messianic Psalms, especially Ps. ii. and cx. But as it is the office of
prophecy only to introduce to the knowledge of the congregation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span> truths absolutely new, it would subvert the
whole relation of psalm-poetry to prophecy, if in these psalms we were to seek for
the origin of the expectations of a personal Messiah. These psalms become intelligible,
only if in Shiloh we recognise the first name of the Messiah. The passage in question,
in combination with the prophetical announcement of the eternal dominion of the
house of David, afforded the complete objective foundation for the subjective poetry
of the Psalms. The eternity of dominion here promised to Judah was, as we learn
from 2 Sam. vii., transferred to David. The exalted person in whom, according to
our passage, the dominion of Judah was to culminate, must then necessarily belong
to the house of David. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;If the passage under review be understood
of the Messiah, we have an excellent fountainhead for all the prophecies of a personal
Messiah; in its significant, enigmatical, and expressive brevity, it is most suitable
for such a purpose. But if its reference to the Messiah be explained away, we are
deprived altogether of a suitable starting-point. In the Davidic psalms, the Messianic
prophecy already more strongly resembles a stream than a fountain.</p>
<p class="normal">So great is the weight of these reasons for the Messianic interpretation,
that we might reasonably have expected that such expositors at least as stand on
the ground of positive Christianity should abandon it only from overwhelming reasons,
or, at least, from such only as are in the highest degree probable. But in this
expectation we have been disappointed. The most superficial objections have been
considered sufficient by <i>Hofmann</i>, <i>Kurtz</i>, and others, to induce them
to disregard the consensus of the whole Christian Church. We cannot, indeed, but
be astonished at this.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Kurtz</i>, following the example of <i>Hofmann</i>, says: &quot;The
organic progress of prophecy, and its correlative connection with history, which
must be maintained in all its stages, forbid us, most decidedly, to assign to the
expectation of a personal Messiah, a period so early as that of the Patriarchs.
The clearly expressed aim of the whole history of this period is the expansion into
a great nation; its whole tendency is directed towards the growth of the multiplicity
of a people from the unity of the Patriarchs. As long as the subject of the history
was the increase into a nation, the idea of a single personal Saviour
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span> could not, by any means, take root. Such could
occur only after they had actually expanded into a great nation in history, and
the necessity had been felt of concentrating the multiplicity of the expanded, into
the unity of a single, individual, <i>i.e.</i>, after one had appeared as the deliverer
and saviour, as the leader and ruler of the whole nation. It is therefore only after
Moses, Joshua, and David, that the expectation of a personal Messiah could arise.&quot;&mdash;Do
you mean to teach God wisdom? we might ask, in answer to such argumentation. To
chain prophecy to history in such a manner, is in reality nothing short of destroying
it. How much soever people may choose to varnish it, this is but another form of
Naturalism, against the influence of which no one is secure, because it is in the
atmosphere of our day. Men who occupy a ground of argumentation so narrow-minded
and trifling,&mdash;who would rather shape history than heartily surrender themselves
to it, and find out, meditate upon, and follow the footsteps of God in it,&mdash;will
be compelled to erase even the promise in Gen. xii. 3, &quot;In thee all the families
of the earth shall be blessed,&quot; yea, even the words, &quot;I will make of thee a great
nation,&quot; with which the promise begins; for even <i>that</i> violates the natural
order. But the historical point of connection for the announcement of a personal
Messiah, which here at once, like a flash of lightning, illuminates the darkness,
is not at all wanting to such a degree as is commonly asserted. On the contrary,
if the blessing upon the heathen be allowed to stand, the expectation of a personal
Saviour must necessarily arise from a consideration of the known events of history,
and meet the immediate revelation of such an one by God. The whole history of the
time of the Patriarchs bears a <i>biographical</i> character. Single individuals
are, in it, the depositaries of the divine promises, the channels of the divine
life. All the blessings of salvation which the congregation possessed at the time
when Jacob&#39;s blessing was uttered, had come to them through single individuals.
Why, then, should the highest Salvation come to them in any other way? Why should
not Abraham be as fit a type of the Messiah as Moses, Joshua, and David,&mdash;Abraham,
of whom God, in Gen. xx. 7, says to Abimelech, the heathen king, &quot;Now therefore
restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet; and if he prays for thee, thou shalt
live?&quot; Or why not Joseph, who, according to Gen. xlvii. 12, &quot;nourished
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span> his father and his brethren, and all his father&#39;s
household,&quot; and whom the grateful Egyptians called &quot;the Saviour of the World?&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Just as untenable is a second argument against the Messianic explanation,&mdash;namely,
that there is no parallelism between the two clauses, &quot;until Shiloh comes,&quot; &quot;and
to Him shall be the obedience of the nations,&quot; but only a pure progress of thought.
The laws of parallelism are not iron fetters; and, moreover, the parallelism in
substance fully exists here, if only it be acknowledged that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;</span> does not signify any kind of obedience,
but only a willing surrender. The words, &quot;until Shiloh comes, and to Him shall be
the obedience of the nations,&quot; are identical in meaning with, &quot;until He cometh,
who bringeth rest, and whom the nations shall willingly obey.&quot; The second member
thus serves to explain the first; the sense would be substantially preserved although
one of the members were wanting. The parallelism is slightly concealed only by the
circumstance that the words run, &quot;to Him the obedience of the nations,&quot;&mdash;instead
of, &quot;He to whom shall be the obedience of the nations.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Let us now take a survey of the principal non-Messianic interpretations.
A suspicion as to their having any foundation at all in the subject itself must
surely be raised by their variety and multiplicity, as well as by the circumstance,
that they who object to the Messianic explanation can never, in any way, succeed
in uniting with each other, but that, with them, one interpretation is sure to be
overthrown by another. Such is, in every case, a sure indication of error.</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, it is possible, in every case, to trace out some interest,
apart from the merits of the question, which has led to the objections against the
Messianic interpretation. With the Jews, it was because they were driven to a strait
by the argumentation of the Christians, that the Messiah must long ago have come,
since sceptre and lawgiver had long ago departed from Judah. The rationalistic interpreters
have evidently been determined by their antipathy to any Messianic prophecies in
the Old Testament. <i>Hofmann</i> and his followers do not in the least conceal
that they are guided by their principle of a concatenation of prophecy with history.</p>
<p class="normal">The opinion, according to which it is maintained that Shiloh is
the name of the well-known locality in Ephraim, has found not a few defenders. Among
these, several, and last of all <span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span> <i>Bleek</i>,
in the <i>Observ.</i>; <i>Hitzig</i>, on Ps. li. 2; <i>Diestel</i>, &quot;der Segen Jacobs,&quot;
translate: &quot;Until he or they come to Shiloh.&quot; The sense is thus supposed to be:
&quot;Judah will be the leader of the tribes, in the journey to Canaan, until they come
to Shiloh.&quot; There, in consequence of the tribes being dispersed to the boundaries
assigned to them, he would then lose his leadership.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_81a" href="#ftn_81a">[13]</a></sup>
But such an explanation is, in every point of view, inadmissible. It is very probable
that the town Shiloh did not exist at all, under this name, at the time of Jacob.
The name nowhere occurs in the Pentateuch; and the Book of Joshua (as we shall show
at a subsequent time) contains traces, far from indistinct, that it arose only after
the occupation of the land by the Israelites. But even supposing that the town of
Shiloh already existed tit the time of Jacob, yet the abrupt mention of a place
so little known would be something strange and unaccountable. It would be out of
the range of Jacob&#39;s visions, which nowhere regard mere details, but have everywhere
for their object only the future in its general outlines. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;The temporary
limitation thus put to the superiority of Judah would be in glaring contradiction
to vers. 8 and 9, where Judah is exalted to be the Lion of God without any limitation
as to time. And, <i>finally</i>,&mdash;Up to the time of their arrival<!--1854 --> in
Shiloh, Judah was never in possession of the sceptre and lawgiver;&mdash;and this reason
would alone be sufficient to overthrow the opinion which we are now combating. We
have already proved that, by these terms, royal power and dominion are designated,
and that, for this reason, the <i>beginning</i> of the fulfilment cannot be sought
for in any period previous to the time of David. But even if we were to come down
to the mere <i>leadership</i> of Judah, we could demonstrate that even this did
not belong to him. His marching in front of the others cannot, even in the remotest
degree, be considered as a leadership. Moses, who belonged to another tribe, had
been solemnly called by God to the chief command. Nor was Joshua
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span> of the tribe of Judah. In him, on the contrary,
there appeared the germ of Ephraim&#39;s superiority, which continued through the whole
period of the Judges, and which came to an end only by David&#39;s having been raised
to the royal dignity. (Compare my commentary on Ps. lxxviii.)</p>
<p class="normal">Others (<i>Tuch</i>, <i>Maurer</i>) give the explanation: &quot;As
long as they come to Shiloh.&quot; This, according to them, the &quot;poet&quot; meant to be identical
with: &quot;in all eternity.&quot; They think that his (the &quot;poet&#39;s&quot;) meaning was, that the
holy tabernacle, which at his time (<i>Tuch</i> assigns the composition of Jacob&#39;s
blessing to the period of Samuel) was at Shiloh, would remain there to all eternity.
To this exposition it would be alone sufficient to object that, according to it,
the phrase <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1497;</span>, which uniformly means only
&quot;until,&quot; is taken in the signification &quot;as long as.&quot; <i>Further</i>,&mdash;History plainly
enough shows how little the sanctuary was considered to be bound to Shiloh; to which
place it had been brought, not in consequence of an express divine declaration,
but only in accordance with Joshua&#39;s own views. When the ark of the covenant was
carried away by the Philistines, this was considered as an express declaration of
God, that He would no longer dwell in Shiloh. How different was the case as regards
Jerusalem! Notwithstanding the destruction by the Chaldees, the city continued to
be the seat of the sanctuary. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;This view implies a strange blending
of gross error&mdash;viz., the supposition that the sanctuary would remain for ever in
Shiloh&mdash;and of true prophecy, viz., the announcement, uttered at the time of Ephraim&#39;s
leadership, of the dominion of the tribe of Judah, which was first realized in David&#39;s
royalty. The only ground in support of the Ephraimitic Shiloh&mdash;the fact, namely,
that Shiloh, wherever else it occurs in the Old Testament, always signifies the
name of the place&mdash;we hope to invalidate by and by; when it will be seen that the
town received its name only on the ground of the passage now under consideration.</p>
<p class="normal">Other opponents of the Messianic interpretation take Shiloh as
a <i>nomen appellativum</i>, in the signification of <i>rest</i>. They translate
either, &quot;Until rest cometh and people obey him&quot; (thus <i>Vater</i>, <i>Gesenius</i>,
<i>Knobel</i>), or, &quot;Until he comes (or, they come) to rest&quot; (thus <i>Hofmann</i>,
<i>Kurtz</i>, and others). By &quot;rest,&quot; they understand either the political rest
enjoyed under David and Solomon, or they find here expressed the idea of eternal
rest in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span> the expected Messianic time. Thus do
<i>Gesenius</i>, <i>Hofmann</i>, and <i>Kurtz</i> understand it. The last-named
determines the sense thus: &quot;Judah shall remain in the uninterrupted possession of
a princely position among his brethren, until through warfare and by victory he
shall have realized the aim, object, and consummation of his sovereignty in the
attained enjoyment of happy rest and undisturbed peace, and in the willing and joyful
obedience of the nations.&quot; But this explanation is to be suspected, simply from
the circumstance, that, in whatever other place Shiloh occurs, it is used as a
<i>nomen proprium</i>; while it is entirely overthrown by the circumstance, that,
according to its form, as already deduced, Shiloh can be nothing else than a <i>
nomen proprium</i>.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_83a" href="#ftn_83a">[14]</a></sup>
We here only remark, by way of anticipation, that David, Solomon, Isaiah, and Ezekiel
bear testimony against this explanation. An interpretation which dissevers the connection
betwixt Shiloh and Shiloh, betwixt Shiloh and Solomon, betwixt Shiloh and the Prince
of Peace, betwixt Shiloh and Him &quot;whose is the judgment,&quot; must be, thereby, self-condemned.
Against the explanation, &quot;Until he comes to rest,&quot; it may also be urged, that the
Accusative could not here stand after a verb of motion; it was too natural to consider
Shiloh as the subject. If it had been intended in any other sense, a preposition
would have been absolutely requisite.</p>
<p class="normal">We further remark, that vers. 11 and 12, which ancient and modern
interpreters, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Kurtz</i>, have attempted to bring into artificial
connection with ver. 10, simply &quot;finish the picture of Judah&#39;s happiness by a description
of the luxurious fulness of his rich territory&quot; (<i>Tuch</i>). Their tenor is quite
different from that which precedes, where a pre-eminence was assigned to Judah;
for they contain nothing beyond a simple, positive declaration. What is in them
assigned to Judah, belongs to him only as a part of the whole, as a fellow-heir
of the country flowing with milk and honey, and corresponds entirely with the blessings
upon the other sons, which are, almost all of them, only individual applications
of the general blessing. It is evidently parallel to what, in vers. 25, 26, is said
of Joseph, and in ver 20 of Asher. That which Jacob here assigns to Judah, was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span> formerly, in Gen. xxvii. 28, assigned by Isaac
to Jacob, and in him to the whole people: &quot;God give thee of the dew of heaven, and
the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.&quot; Hence, it is not at all
necessary to examine history for the purpose of ascertaining whether Judah was distinguished
above the other tribes, by plenty of wine and milk.</p>
<p class="normal">We need not lose much time in discussing the attempts which have
been made to assign the blessing of Jacob to a later period. The futility of all
of them is proved by the circumstance, that we have not here before us any special
predictions, such as are peculiar to <i>vaticinia post eventum</i>, but general
prophetical outlines, individual applications of the general blessings, exemplifications.
Whatever seems, at first sight, to be different, melts away while handling it. Thus,
for example, the blessings which Israel enjoyed by his dwelling on the sea-side,
are pointed out in the blessing upon Zebulun, because he had his name from the
<i>dwelling</i>, Gen. xxi. 20. That Zebulun is here viewed only as a part of the
whole, appears from the fact that, afterwards, he did not live by the sea at all.
In the case of Issachar, it was the individuality of the ancestor Jacob which gave
him occasion to describe, from his own example, the dangers of an indolent rest.
History does not say anything of Issachar alone having yielded to these dangers
in a peculiar degree. In the case of Joseph, the events personal to the son are
transferred to the tribe, and in the tribe, to the whole nation. In an inimitable
manner the tender love of the father towards his son and provider meets us here.
The only thing which goes beyond the human sphere of Jacob, is the prediction by
which Judah is placed in the centre of the world&#39;s history. But it is just this
which, even in its beginnings, goes beyond the time at which this pretended <i>vaticinium
post eventum</i> is placed by <i>Tuch</i>, <i>Bleek</i>, and <i>Ewald</i>; for,
by this assumption of theirs, they are necessarily limited to the time before David,
if they wish to avoid the insurmountable difficulties which arise from what is said
of Levi and of Joseph. But to the man who looks deeper, vers. 8-10 are just the
seal of the divinity, and hence of the genuineness also, of this prophecy, and,
with all his heart, he will hate such miserable conjectures.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_84a" href="#ftn_84a">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p class="normal">Let us now follow through history Jacob&#39;s blessing upon Judah.
From this inquiry it will appear how deep has been the impression made by it upon
the people of the covenant. On this occasion also, it will be seen still more distinctly
what the right is which rationalistic criticism has to declare this <i>fundamental
prophecy</i> to be the recent production of an obscure poet. The chain-like character
of Holy Scripture will be seen in a very striking light.</p>
<p class="normal">In Num. ii. regulations are laid down respecting the order in
which the tribes are to encamp about the tabernacle, and in which they are to set
forth. &quot;On the east side, towards which the entrance of the sanctuary is directed,
and hence in the front, Judah, as the principal tribe, is encamped; and the two
sons of his mother&mdash;Issachar and Zebulun&mdash;who were born immediately after him, pitch
next to him. On the south side there is the camp, with the standard, of Reuben;
and next to him are his brother Simeon, who was born immediately after him, and
Gad, one of the sons of his mother&#39;s maid. The west side is assigned to the sons
of Rachel, with Ephraim at their head. And, <i>finally</i>, on the north side, the
three other sons of the maids, viz., Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, have their position.
In the same order as they encamp they are also to set forth.&quot; (<i>Baumgarten</i>.)</p>
<p class="normal">Judah is the chief tribe on the chief side. This distinction
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span> is not based on the deeds hitherto performed
by Judah, nor is it the result of any revelation which Moses received upon the subject.
It is regarded as a matter of course. And yet, there must necessarily have been
some foundation for such a distinction, because, otherwise, it would have called
forth the opposition of the other tribes, especially of that of Ephraim. Such a
foundation, however, is afforded only by the blessing of Jacob, in which the tribe
of Judah appears as the leading one. The complete realization of this prediction
is left, indeed, in the hand of God; but the bearer of honours so great, even although
future, must, in the prospect of that future, enjoy, even in the present, a certain
distinction; such distinction, however, as does not at all imply sovereignty.</p>
<p class="normal">But we are compelled to have recourse to Genesis, and especially
to chap. xlix., the more because the whole arrangement of the camp has evidently
its foundation in Genesis, and the key to a whole series of facts in it can be found
only in chap. xlix. If we ask why it is that the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun
are subordinate to Judah; that Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, that Ephraim and Benjamin,
that Dan, Asher, and Naphtali are encamped by each other; it is in Genesis alone
that we are furnished with the answer.</p>
<p class="normal">The position which Reuben occupies specially points to Gen. xlix.
As the first-born, he ought to stand at the head; but here we find him occupying
the second place. In Gen. xlix. Jacob says to him, on account of his guilt, &quot;Thou
shalt not excel;&quot; and &quot;the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power,&quot;
which up to that time he had possessed, are transferred to Judah. Yet Moses has
so much regard to his original dignity, that he places him immediately after Judah;
the utterance of Jacob did not entitle him to assign to him a lower position. <i>
Further</i>,&mdash;The reason why Dan stands at the head of the sons of the maids is explained
only in Gen. xlix. 16-18, where Dan is specially distinguished among them, and where
it is specially said of him, &quot;Dan shall judge his people.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">If the blessing of Jacob be the production of a later time, then
the order of the encampment, which rests upon it, must necessarily be so also; but
such an idea will at once be discarded by every man of sound judgment. Even they
who refuse to acknowledge Moses as the author of the Pentateuch, admit that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span> those regulations which bear reference only
to the condition of things in the wilderness must have originated from him.</p>
<p class="normal">But exactly the same order which Moses in Num. ii. prescribes
for the encampment and setting forth of the tribes, is found again in chap. vii.,
where there is described the offerings which the princes of the tribes offered at
the dedication of the altar. Every prince has here a day to himself, and here also
does Judah occupy the first place: &quot;And he that offered his offering the first day
was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.&quot;&mdash;If any one should venture
to set down this chapter also, with all its details, as a fabrication of later times,
he would only betray an utter absence of all scientific judgment.</p>
<p class="normal">According to Num. x. 14, Judah led the march when they set forth
from Sinai.</p>
<p class="normal">Balaam&#39;s prophecies, the genuineness of which is proved by so
many weighty arguments (compare the enumeration of them in my work on Balaam), rest,
in general, on the fundamental prophecies of Genesis, but especially on the blessing
of Jacob upon Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">In Num. xxiii. 24, Balaam says: &quot;Behold, a people, like a full-grown
lion he rises, and like a lion he lifts himself up. Not shall he lie down until
he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.&quot; This conclusion of Balaam&#39;s
second prophecy, which at once demolishes Balak&#39;s vain hopes of victory, by pointing
out the dreadful power of Israel, unconquerable by all his enemies, and crushing
them all, has an intentional reference to Gen. xlix. 9,&mdash;a reference specially suitable
for such a conclusion. What was there ascribed to Judah is here transferred to Israel,
whose fore-champion Judah is. &quot;Dost thou think,&quot; says Balaam to Balak, &quot;of being
able to overcome them, to stop them in their course towards the mark held out to
them? Behold, according to an old revelation of their God, they are a people destroying
their enemies with the lion&#39;s strength. Therefore, get thee out of their way, lest
such a fate befall thee.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In Num. xxiv. 9, Balaam says, &quot;He couches, he lies as a lion,
and as a great lion, who shall stir him up?&quot; As in the preceding prophecy he had
pointed out Israel&#39;s dreadful power which secures to him victory in the battle,
so here he shows how, even after having finished the battle, this power so intimidates
his enemies, that they do not venture to disturb his peace.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span> That which Jacob had said of Judah, is, with
intended literality, here transferred to Israel.</p>
<p class="normal">In Num. xxiv. 17, we read: &quot;I see him, but not now; I behold him,
but not nigh: a star goeth out of Jacob, and a sceptre riseth out of Israel, and
smiteth the borders of Moab, and destroyeth all the sons of the tumult.&quot;&mdash;As the
two preceding utterances carry us back to Gen. xlix. 9, so this one refers to ver.
10, where the sceptre, the emblem of dominion, denotes, just as it does in this
passage, dominion itself, and where to Judah, and in him to all Israel, the kingdom
is promised which shall at last be consummated in the Shiloh. The meaning of the
words, &quot;A sceptre riseth out of Israel,&quot; is explained in ver. 19 by the words, &quot;Dominion
shall come out of Jacob.&quot; Jacob has in view the internal relations among his descendants,
and hence he speaks specially of Judah; but Balaam, in accordance with his object,
speaks of Israel only. Jacob points, at the close, to Shiloh&#39;s just and peaceful
dominion; but Balaam, who has to do with the enraged and obstinate enemies of Israel,
points out, from among the effects produced by the star and sceptre, only the victorious
might, and destructive power which these will display in the conflict with the enemies
of Israel.</p>
<p class="normal">In the blessing of Moses, Deut. xxxii.<!--xxxiii. is correct chapter-->
7, it is said of Judah: &quot;Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his
people; with his hands he fights for himself, and be Thou an help to him from his
enemies.&quot; Even the remarkable brevity of this utterance points back to the blessing
of Jacob. With this brevity, the length of the blessing upon Levi, who had been
treated too summarily by Jacob, forms a striking contrast. In the case of Reuben
also, the attempt to pour oil into the wounds then inflicted is visible. The whole
announcement is based upon the supposition that Judah is the fore-champion of Israel;
and this supposition refers us back to Gen. xlix. This appears especially in the
words, &quot;Bring him to his people,&quot; on which light is thrown only by Gen. xlix. It
is for his people that Judah engages in foreign wars, and the Lord, fulfilling the
words, &quot;From the prey, my son, thou goest up,&quot; brings him safely to his people.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_88a" href="#ftn_88a">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span></p>
<p class="normal">There can be no doubt that in Shiloh, as the name of a place,
there is a reference to Gen. xlix. 10. They who rightly denied that Shiloh could,
in that passage, be understood as the name of the place, could, nevertheless, not
feel satisfied as long as they allowed a twofold Shiloh to exist unconnected with
each other. The agreement in the very rare and peculiar form, which nowhere else
occurs, cannot well be a matter of accident.</p>
<p class="normal">In the Pentateuch, Shiloh does not occur at all as the name of
a place. In the passage where Shiloh is first mentioned&mdash;in Josh. xvi. 6&mdash;another
name is beside it, and prefixed to it. According to that passage, the former name
was Taanah. (They who are of opinion that this place was different from Shiloh,
can find no support from the authority of <i>Eusebius</i>; it is not said Taanah
by Shiloh, but Taanath-Shiloh.) After that place had become the seat of the Sanctuary,
the holy name <i>Shiloh</i> took the place of the former natural one. The reason
why this name was given to it is indicated in Josh. xviii. 1: &quot;And the whole congregation
of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle
of the congregation there; <i>and the land was subdued before them</i>.&quot; Compare
also xxi. 44, xxii. 4, where it is remarked that at that time &quot;the Lord gave them
rest round about.&quot; (See <i>Bachiene</i>, <i>Palestina</i> ii. 3, S. 409 ff.) In
the subjection of the country,&mdash;in the rest which the Lord had given them from all
round about, they saw an earnest of, and a prelude to, the obedience of the nations
in general, and to the state of perfect rest which should take place at some future
time with the appearing of Shiloh. Victory, peace! (<i>Siegfried!</i>) such was
the watchword corresponding to the elevated consciousness of the people. It is an
elevation quite similar to that which we so often perceive in the Psalms. &quot;Sometimes
there rises the hope that the Gentiles shall, at some future period, be received
among the people of God&mdash;a hope based upon the experience of the Lord&#39;s victorious
power in the present, in which faith perceives a pledge of the future subjection
of the world&#39;s power under His sceptre. Thus, in vers. 29-32 of Ps. lxviii., which
was composed by David on the occasion of his having, by the help of the Lord, conquered
his most dangerous enemies, the Aramites and Ammonites; in Ps. xlvii., written on
the occasion of Jehoshaphat&#39;s victory over several heathen nations; and in Ps. lxxxvii.,
composed on the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span> ground of the joyful events
under Hezekiah, the germ of the hope for the conversion of the heathen, which had
all along lain dormant in the people, was developed.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_90a" href="#ftn_90a">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">After the main power of the Canaanites had been broken by the
expeditions of all Israel under Joshua, Judah begins, at the command of God, to
expel the Canaanites from the territory assigned to him. In Judges i. 1, 2, we read:
&quot;And the children of Israel asked the Lord, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites
at the beginning to fight against them? And the Lord said, Judah shall go up; behold,
I deliver the land into his hands.&quot; They were concerned to find out the tribe who,
by the decree of God, had been destined to be the fore-champion for his brethren,
and with whom they might be sure of a happy commencement of the war. The short answer,
&quot;Judah shall go up,&quot; would scarcely have been justified, had it not had a foundation
in a previous declaration of God&#39;s will. It indicates that Jacob&#39;s blessing upon
Judah still possessed its power.</p>
<p class="normal">In like manner, in the war against Benjamin, according to divine
direction, Judah goes up first to the battle, forms the vanguard. Judges xx. 18.
The intentional identity of the expression used here and in chap. i., leads us to
the supposition that the words, &quot;Judah shall go up,&quot; have, in both passages, the
same foundation.</p>
<p class="normal">From both of these events, we are led to expect that Judah may
be called to occupy a still more important position. The announcement of Jacob regarding
Judah, to which the words, &quot;Judah shall go up,&quot; refer, finds, in these events, evidently
but a poor beginning of its complete fulfilment. All, however, which was required
in the meantime, was the indication, by gentle touches, of the position which Judah
was called to occupy in future times. It is just God&#39;s way to take time in carrying
out <span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span> His elections; all human conditions must
first disappear. After these two intimations, at the end of the time of Joshua (for
Judges i. 1, 2, belongs to that period; the words, &quot;And it came to pass after the
death of Joshua,&quot; do not refer to what follows immediately after, but only to the
contents of the book as a whole), and at the beginning of the time of the Judges,
Judah retires out of view. During the whole period of the Judges, Ephraim held the
supremacy. Under David, the validity of the election suddenly appeared, and the
announcement of Jacob found a glorious fulfilment; but again, such an one only as
pointed to a still more glorious fulfilment in the future. Before this took place,
however,&mdash;before Shiloh came, to whom the obedience of the people was promised, the
lamp of Judah was once more to be extinguished, so that, to human eyes, it should
be invisible for many centuries.</p>
<p class="normal">In 1 Chron. xxviii. 4, David says: &quot;And the Lord God of Israel
chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for
He hath chosen Judah to be the ruler, and in the house of Judah, the house of my
father, and in the house of my father. He liked me to make me king over all Israel.&quot;
David here points to an event by which Judah was raised to be the ruling tribe;
and such an election is nowhere else to be found than in Gen. xlix. We cannot for
a moment suppose that Judah was elected only in, and with, the election of David.
Against such a supposition militates the fact, that even the election of David&#39;s
house is represented in history as being distinct from the election of David himself;
for in 1 Sam. xvi. the decree of God is first made known, that one of Jesse&#39;s sons
is to be king; and it is only afterwards that we are told which of them is to be
chosen. The expression too, &quot;He hath chosen Judah to be the <i>ruler</i>,&quot; is decisive
against it; for this expression has an evident reference to the sceptre and lawgiver
in Gen. xlix. But if any doubt should still remain, it would be entirely removed
by the parallel passage in 1 Chron. v. 2, where, in the words, &quot;For Judah was mighty
among his brethren, and of him the prince was to come,&quot; there is an allusion, which
cannot be mistaken, to Gen. xlix.</p>
<p class="normal">There cannot be a doubt that David gave to his son the name Solomon,
because he hoped that, in his just and peaceful reign, he would be a type of the
Shiloh whom the nation should willingly <span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span> obey,
just as, in his own reign, there had been the first grand fulfilment of what Jacob
had prophesied of Judah&#39;s lion-courage, and lion-strength,&mdash;of Judah&#39;s sceptre and
lawgiver. We have here the counterpart of the fact, that the children of Israel,
after the first occupation of the country, gave to the seat of the sanctuary the
name of Shiloh. In the case of Solomon, both the name and the substance point to
Shiloh. With regard to the <i>name</i>, three out of the four letters of which the
name <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span> consists, are common to it with
Shiloh. The signification is precisely the same; so also is the form. In
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span> as well as in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span> we meet with the very rare case of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1503;</span> at the end being thrown off. In <i>Ewald&#39;s</i>
Grammar, § 163, these two names are, for this reason, pointed out and placed immediately
beside each other. And, with regard to the agreement in the <i>substance</i>, we
refer to 1 Chron. xxii. 9, where Nathan says to David: &quot;Behold, a son shall be born
to thee, who shall be a man of <i>rest</i>, and I will give him <i>rest</i> from
all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
and quietness unto Israel in his days.&quot; We refer, <i>further</i>, to 1 Kings v.
4, where Solomon says to Hiram: &quot;And now the Lord my God hath given me <i>rest</i>
round about; there is neither adversary nor evil obstacle.&quot; We refer, <i>finally</i>,
to 1 Kings v. 4, 5 (iv. 24, 25): &quot;He had dominion over all the region on the other
side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on the other side
of the river, and he had peace from all his servants round about. And Judah and
Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and fig-tree, from Dan even to Beersheba,
all the days of Solomon.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_92a" href="#ftn_92a">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">But if any further doubt should remain as regards the typical
relation in which Solomon stands to Shiloh, it would be removed by Ps. lxxii., which
discards the very idea that Solomon could be anything more than a type,&mdash;that any
hope had ever been entertained of his being himself the Shiloh. Even David&#39;s Messianic
Psalms bear witness against such an opinion. In harmony with the words of our Lord
in Matt. xii. 42, &quot;A <span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span> greater than Solomon is
here,&quot; Solomon In this Psalm points beyond himself. In his own just and peaceful
dominion, he beholds a type of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace, who, by His justice
and love, shall obtain dominion over the world, and whom all kings shall worship,
and all the heathen shall serve. How closely this Psalm is connected with Gen. xlix.
is pointed out by Ezekiel, in a passage of which we shall immediately treat.</p>
<p class="normal">In ver. 9 of Ps. lx., which was composed by David, the words,
&quot;Judah is my lawgiver&quot;&mdash;equivalent to, Judah is my, <i>i.e.</i>, Israel&#39;s ruling
tribe&mdash;point to Gen. xlix. 10, according to which the lawgiver shall not depart from
Judah; just as ver. 13, &quot;Give us help from the enemy,&quot; alludes to Deut. xxxiii.
7, where it is said of Judah, &quot;Be thou a help to him from his enemies,&quot; and ver.
14, to Num. xxiv. 18.</p>
<p class="normal">That the Prince of Peace spoken of in Is. ix. 5, under whom there
is &quot;no end to the increase of government and of peace,&quot; refers to the Peaceful One,
to whom the nations render obedience, will not be doubted by those who have recognised
the connection in which Solomon and Ps. lxxii. stand to the Shiloh. Nor will such
fail to recognise an allusion to the Shiloh in all the other passages of the Prophets,
in which the Messiah is described as the Author of rest and peace; <i>e.g.</i>,
Mic. iv. 1-4; Is. ii. 2-4; Zech. ix. 10; and the less so, the more clearly it appears,
from passages of Ezekiel, what influence Gen. xlix. exercised over the prophetic
consciousness. Isaiah significantly alludes to it in other passages also. In chap.
xxix. 1, 2, he says: &quot;Woe to Ariel, (<i>i.e.</i>, Lion of God), the city where David
encamped! Add ye year to year, let the feasts revolve. And I distress Ariel, and
there shall be heaviness and affliction, but it shall be unto me as Ariel;&quot;&mdash;the
meaning of which is: Jerusalem will, in times to come, endure heavy affliction (through
Asshur), but the world-conquering power of the kingdom of God will manifest itself
in her deliverance. The name Ariel is emphatically placed at the beginning, and,
in it, the Prophet gives to the congregation of God a guarantee for her deliverance.
That which Jacob had said of Judah, who, to him, appeared as the invincible lion
of God, is here applied to Zion, the city where David encamped, the centre of the
kingdom of Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">Ezekiel, in his lamentation over the princes of Israel who,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span> in his time, were standing just at the brink
of the abyss, says in chap. xix. 2: &quot;Thy mother was a lioness, who lay down among
lionesses, and brought up her whelps among young lions.&quot; The mother is the congregation
of Judah. The image of the lion points to the blessing of Jacob, and its fulfilment
in history. &quot;Judah once couched in a threatening position, endangering his adversaries,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_94a" href="#ftn_94a">[19]</a></sup>
in the midst of lions, <i>i.e.</i>, among the other powerful kingdoms fond of conquests.&quot;
(<i>Hävernick</i>.) </p>
<p class="normal">In Ezek. xxi. 15, 18 (10-15), the Lord, with an evident allusion
to Gen. xlix. 10, announces the (temporary) destruction of the sceptre of His son
(<i>i.e.</i>, Israel or Judah), a sceptre which despises all other sceptres.</p>
<p class="normal">In vers. 30-32 (25-27) of the same chapter, Ezekiel foretells,
in the name of the Lord, a complete overturning of all relations, a total revolution,
in which the Davidic kingdom especially is brought down, a condition of affairs
in which rest and safety will not anywhere be found. This state of things is to
continue &quot;until He comes to whom is the judgment; to Him I will give it.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The reference of this passage to Gen. xlix. cannot be mistaken.
It was recognised, indeed, by the ancient translators; only that most of them erroneously
found in it an explanation instead of an allusion.</p>
<p class="normal">Instead of the words, &quot;to whom is the judgment,&quot; we should, from
the expression used in Gen. xlix. 10, &quot;Until Shiloh cometh,&quot; have expected, &quot;to
whom is peace;&quot; but Ezekiel has filled up Gen. xlix. 10 from Ps. lxxii. 1-5, where
judgment and righteousness appear as the basis of the peace which the Anointed One
shall bring. And <i>peace</i> occupies the background in Ezekiel also. The advent
of Him to whom is the judgment, in contrast with the injustice and wickedness of
those who were hitherto the bearers of the sceptre, puts an end to strife, confusion,
and destruction. That, in like manner, in Gen. xlix., the <i>judgment</i> occupies
the background, we see plainly, from the commentary upon that passage furnished
by Ps. lxxii., as well as from Is. ix. and ii. In Ps. lxxii., peace comes into consideration,
only in so far as it is a product and consequence of justice, which is an attribute
of the King, and is by him <span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span> infused into the
life of the nation. In vers. 1-50, the thought is: &quot;God gives righteousness to His
King, and in consequence of it, righteousness and the fear of God become indigenous
to the people, and these again bring peace in their train.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Every word in Ezekiel is taken from Gen. xlix. and Ps. lxxii.
From the latter are taken the words, &quot;judgment,&quot; and &quot;I will give it.&quot; (Compare
Ps. lxxii. 1: &quot;Give the King thy judgments.&quot;) The combination of these two passages
points out their close connection, and indicates that Ps. lxxii. is to be viewed
as a comment. <i>Onkelos</i>, who thus translates the passage in Gen. xlix., &quot;Until
Messiah comes, to whom the kingdom is due, and Him the people shall obey,&quot; has very
properly only supplemented the declaration of Jacob from Ezekiel, or, at least,
has taken thence the explanation of Shiloh.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">But, at the same time, the words
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;</span>, which, on the basis of Ps. lxxii.,
Ezekiel puts in the place of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, allude
to the letters of the latter word which forms the initials of the words in Ezekiel.
That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;</span> is the main letter in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;</span>, is shown by the common abbreviation of
it into <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;</span>; and that the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;</span> in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;</span>
is unessential, is proved by the circumstance that the name of the place is often
written <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, and that even in Gen. xlix. 10,
a number of manuscripts have this orthography.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;From the allusion to a prophecy so well known, and so frequently
used, the brevity of the prophecy in Ezekiel is to be explained. It forms a most
powerful conclusion and resting-point for the prophetic discourse.&quot; (<i>Hävernick</i>.)
</p>
<p class="normal">There cannot be any doubt that Ezekiel found in Gen. xlix. 10,
the prophecy of a personal Messiah. They, therefore, who assert that no such prophecy
is contained in our passage, must, at the same time, assert that Ezekiel misunderstood
it; yea, even more, that, even as early as at that period, a false view of that
passage was generally prevalent. For, the manner in which Ezekiel alludes to it
presupposes that, at that time, the view which found in it a personal Messiah was
generally held. If we observe still further, that Ezekiel connected the allusion
to Ps. lxxii. with that to Gen. xlix., we cannot hesitate for a moment to admit
that he understood the name Shiloh to be Rest-maker, Peace-maker; only, that on
the ground of Ps. lxxii., he mentions the cause instead of the effect. He had, moreover,
the stronger reason for designating the bearer of peace as the bearer of judgment,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span> because, in his time, the want of judgment
had evidently produced the absence of peace, and the general confusion, misery,
and destruction.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;As in Gen. xlix. the Patriarch sees a light rising at a far distance,
and spreading its brightness over the darkness of centuries, so in Ezekiel also,
the same ray of glorious hope lightens through the dark night of confusion and unutterable
misery in which he sees himself enveloped.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Kurtz</i>, S. 266, has altogether denied the connection of
the passage in Ezekiel with Gen. xlix. These two passages are, as he thinks, altogether
different, inasmuch as Ezekiel announces destruction and desolation which shall
continue until He comes to whom is the judgment, while Gen. xlix., when understood
of a personal Messiah, announces dominion which shall continue until Shiloh comes.
But Ezekiel does not contradict Gen. xlix. 10. He gives only the supplement necessary
for preventing this passage from being considered as a permission to sin, and from
becoming a support of false security. Ezekiel, too, assumes a continuation of the
dominion. If that were not concealed behind the destruction, how could &quot;the coming
of Him to whom is the judgment&quot; be pointed out as the limit of that destruction?
The tree indeed is cut down, but the root remains in its full vigour.</p>
<p class="normal">When Jacob announces that the sceptre shall not depart until Shiloh,
the prince of peace, cometh, he can thereby mean only that it would not depart
<i>definitively</i>; for, otherwise, he would have belied his own experience. From
the way by which the Lord had led him, he had sufficiently learnt that God&#39;s promises
to sinful men must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>; that they never exclude the
visitation of the elect on account of their sins, and that it is only in the end
that God will bring all to a glorious fulfilment. When he went to Mesopotamia, God
had said to him, &quot;I am with thee, and I will keep thee in all places whither thou
goest,&quot; Gen. xxviii. 15; and yet the deceit which he had practised upon his father
and brother was recompensed to him there by the deceit of Laban, and he was obliged
to say, &quot;In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep
departed from mine eyes,&quot; Gen. xxxi. 40. When he came from the land of the two rivers,
God blessed him and gave him the honourable name of Israel, Gen. xxxii.; and yet
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span> he had soon thereafter to experience grievous
distress on account of Dinah and Joseph; and in chap. xxxvii. 34, 35, we are told
concerning him: &quot;And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
mourned for his son many days. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to
comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, I shall go down into the
grave unto my son in sorrow.&quot; In the kingdom of God there are no other promises
than such as resemble those rivers which flow alternately above and below ground,
since it is certain that all the subjects of the promises are affected by sin.</p>
<p class="normal">Ezekiel xliii. 15 likewise refers to the blessing of Jacob upon
Judah. The altar for the burnt-offerings in the new temple is first called <i>Harel</i>
= the mountain of God, and afterwards <i>Ariel</i> = the Lion of God,&mdash;indicating
that what had been promised to Judah in Gen. xlix., viz., the Lion&#39;s nature and
invincible power, victorious over all enemies, has its root in the altar,&mdash;in the
circumstance that the people of God are a people whose sins are forgiven, who dedicate
themselves to God, and give Him thanks and praise.</p>
<p class="normal">A very remarkable reference to Gen. xlix. meets us at the very
threshold of the New Testament. In Luke ii. 13, 14, the heavenly host praise God,
saying: &quot;Glory be to God in the highest, and on earth peace.&quot; The words, &quot;glory&quot;
or &quot;praise be to God,&quot; are an allusion to Judah, and to the glorious things foretold
in Gen. xlix. of him who centres in Christ. Christ is the true Judah,&mdash;He by whom
God is glorified, John xiv. 13. The words, &quot;on earth peace,&quot; contain the explanation
of the name Shiloh, the first name under which the Saviour is celebrated in the
Old Testament.</p>
<p class="normal">As the words with which the Saviour is first introduced into the
world allude to Gen. xlix., so the Lord Himself, before His departure, alludes to
this fundamental Messianic prophecy in John xiv. 27: &quot;Peace I leave with you. My
peace I give unto you;&quot; and in xvi. 33: &quot;These things I have spoken unto you, that
in Me ye might have peace.&quot; So also, after His resurrection, Christ says, in the
circle of His disciples, &quot;Peace be unto you,&quot; John xx. 19, 21, 26.</p>
<p class="normal">The last book of the entire Holy Scripture&mdash;the Apocalypse<span class="pagenum">[Pg
98]</span>&mdash;likewise points back to the remarkable prophecy of Christ at the close
of its first book. In Rev. v. 5, we read: &quot;And one of the elders saith unto me,
Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed.&quot;
&quot;The designation of Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, rests on Gen. xlix.
9. Judah appears there as a lion, in order to denote his warlike and victorious
powers. But Judah himself, according to the blessing of dying Jacob, is at some
future period to centre in the Messiah. As a type, he had formerly centred already
in David, in whom the lion-nature of the tribe of Judah was manifested.&quot; This allusion
shows that even what Is said in vers. 8, 9, found its complete fulfilment only in
Christ, and that vers. 8, 9, are parallel to the entire ver. 10, and not to its
first half only.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Bengel</i> remarks on Rev. v. 6: &quot;The elder had pointed John
to a Lion, and yet John beheld a Lamb. The Lord Jesus is called a Lion only once
in this prophecy, and that, at the very beginning, before the appellation Lamb appears.
This indicates that as often as the Lamb is remembered, we should also remember
Him as the Lion of the tribe of Judah.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">As the designation of Christ as the Lion refers to what, in the
blessing of Jacob, is said of the lion-nature of the tribe of Judah, so, in the
&quot;Lamb&quot;&mdash;the emblem of innocence, justice, silent patience and gentleness&mdash;the name
Shiloh is embodied.</p>

	the time of Mohammed often recited long poems extempore,&mdash;so natural to them
	was poetry. (Compare <i>Tharaphæ Moallakah</i>, ed. <i>Reiske</i>, p. xl.;
	<i>Antaræ Moallakah</i>, ed. <i>Menil.</i> p. 18.) The poet <i>Lebid</i>, who
	attained to the age of 157 years (compare <i>Reiske prolegg. ad Thar. Moall.</i>
	p. xxx.; <i>De Sacy</i>, <i>Memoires de l&#39;Academie des inscriptions</i>, p.
	403 ff.), composed a poem when he was dying; compare <i>Herbelot Bibl. Or.</i>
	p. 513. The poet <i>Hareth</i> was 135 years old when he recited extempore his
	<i>Moallakah</i>, which is still extant; compare <i>Reiske</i> l.c. The objection,
	too, that it is inconceivable how the blessing spoken by Jacob could have been
	handed down <i>verbatim</i> to Moses, finds its best refutation in the history
	of Arabic poetry. The art of writing was introduced among the Arabs only a short
	time before Mohammed. (Compare <i>de Sacy</i> l.c. pp. 306, 348; <i>Amrulkeisi
	Moall.</i> ed. <i>Hengstenberg</i>, p. 3.) Up to that time, even the longest
	poems, of which some consisted of more than a hundred verses, were preserved
	by mere oral tradition (compare <i>Nuweiri</i> in <i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Zoheiri
	Moall.</i> p. 11); and the internal condition of those which have been preserved
	to us bears the best testimony to their having been faithfully handed down.
	But in the case before us, something altogether different from a poem was concerned.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_98" href="#div2Ref_98">BALAAM&#39;S PROPHECY.</a></h2>
<h3>(Numb. xxiv. 17-19.)</h3>
<p class="normal">Carried by the Spirit into the far distant future, Balaam sees
here how a star goeth out of Jacob and a sceptre riseth out of Israel, and how this
sceptre smiteth Moab, by whose enmity the Seer had been brought from a distant region
for the destruction of Israel. And not Moab only shall be smitten, but its southern
neighbour, Edom, too shall be subdued, whose hatred against Israel had already been
prefigured in its ancestor, and had now begun to display Itself; and In general,
all the enemies of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span> people of God shall
be cast down to the ground by the Ruler out of Jacob.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 17. &quot;<i>I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh.</i>
<i>A star goeth out of Jacob, and a sceptre riseth out of Israel, and</i> <i>smiteth
the borders of Moab, and destroyeth all the sons of the</i> <i>tumult.</i> Ver.
18. <i>And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir</i> <i>shall be a possession&mdash;his
enemies, and Israel acquireth might.</i> Ver. 19. <i>And a Ruler shall come out
of Jacob, and destroyeth</i> <i>what remaineth out of the city.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The star is, in Scripture, the symbol of the splendour of power.
The sceptre leads us back to Gen. xlix. 10; and, in general, the announcements of
Balaam have, throughout, the promises and hopes of the Patriarchs for their foundation.
As in the fundamental passage, so here also, the sceptre, the symbol of dominion,
stands for dominion itself. The substance of the two figurative expressions is briefly
stated in ver. 19, in the words, &quot;They shall rule out of Jacob,&quot; which are tantamount
to, &quot;A Ruler shall come out of Jacob.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">A difference of opinion exists regarding the glorious King who
is here announced. From the earliest times, the Jews understood thereby the Messiah,
either exclusively, or, at least, principally, so as to admit of a secondary reference
to David. <i>Onkelos</i> translates: &quot;When a King shall rise out of Jacob, and out
of Israel Messiah shall be anointed;&quot;&mdash;<i>Jonathan</i>: &quot;When a valiant King shall
rise out of the house of Jacob, and out of Israel, Messiah, and a strong Sceptre
shall be anointed.&quot; The Book of Sohar remarks on the words, &quot;I see him, but now:&quot;
&quot;This was in part fulfilled at that time; it will be completely fulfilled in the
days of Messiah.&quot; (Compare the passages in <i>Jos. de</i> <i>Voisin</i>, in the
<i>Prooem.</i> on <i>R. Martini Pugio fid.</i> p. 68; <i>R. Martini</i> iii. 3,
c. 11; <i>Schöttgen</i>, &quot;<i>Jesus Messias</i>,&quot; S. 151.) How widely this opinion
was spread among the Jews, is sufficiently apparent from the circumstance, that
the renowned pseudo-Messiah in the time of Hadrian adopted, with reference to the
passage under review, the surname <i>Barcochba</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Son of the Star.&mdash;From
the Jews, this interpretation very soon passed over to the Christians, who rightly
found a warrant for it in the narrative of the star of the wise men from the East.
<i>Cyril</i> of Jerusalem defended the Messianic interpretation against <i>Julian</i>.
(Compare <i>Julian</i>, ed. <i>Spanh.</i> p. 263 c. See other passages
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span> from the fathers of the Church in <i>Calov.</i>)
According to <i>Theodoret</i> (Quest. 44 in Numb.), there were, indeed, some to
whom &quot;Balaam appeared to have foretold nothing concerning our Saviour;&quot; but this
opinion was rejected as profane. The Messianic interpretation has, in a narrower
and wider sense&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as referring in the first instance to David, but in
the highest and proper sense to Christ&mdash;become the prevailing one in the Evangelical
Church also. It was defended even by such interpreters as <i>Calvin</i> and <i>Clericus</i>,
who, as to other passages, differed from the prevailing Messianic interpretation.
(Compare especially <i>Mieg</i>, <i>de Stella et Sceptro Baleamitico</i> in the
<i>Thes. Nov.</i> p. 423 sqq., and <i>Boullier</i>, <i>Dissert. Syll. Amsterdam</i>
1750, <i>Diss.</i> I.) On the other hand, the Messianic interpretation found a zealous
and ingenious opponent, first in <i>Verschnir</i> in the <i>Bibl. Brem.</i> <i>nova</i>,
reprinted in his <i>Opusc.</i> He was joined by the rationalistic interpreters,
who maintained an exclusive reference to David. But <i>Rosenmüller</i> and <i>Baumgarten-Crusius</i>
(bibl. Theol. S. 369) returned to the Messianic interpretation.</p>
<p class="normal">The question at issue is chiefly this:&mdash;Whether by the star and
sceptre some single Israelitish king is designated, or rather, an ideal person&mdash;the
personified Israelitish kingdom. The latter view I proved, in my work on Balaam,
to be the correct one, for the following reasons:&mdash;1. The reference to a certain
Israelitish king is against the analogy of the other prophecies of the Pentateuch.
A single person, especially a single king of future time, is nowhere announced in
it,&mdash;except the Messiah, whose announcement, however, is different from that of David.
But, on the other hand, the rise of the <i>kingdom</i> in Israel is announced as
early as in the promise to the Patriarchs, on which all of Balaam&#39;s declarations
rest throughout. It is only to this that the words, &quot;A star goeth out of Jacob,
and a sceptre riseth out of Israel,&quot; can refer,&mdash;according to the analogy of Gen.
xvii. 6: &quot;Kings shall come out of thee;&quot; ver. 16: &quot;And she shall become nations,
<i>kings</i> of people shall be of her;&quot; and xxxv. 11: &quot;Kings shall come out of
thy loins.&quot; 2. The reference to a single king would be against the <i>analogy</i>
of <i>Balaam&#39;s</i> prophecies, inasmuch as these nowhere refer to a single individual.
3. The <i>sceptre</i> does not, in itself, lead us to think of an individual, since
it does not designate a ruler, but dominion in general. But that which especially
militates against the reference <span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span> to an individual
is the comparison with the fundamental passage, Gen. xlix. 10, in which Judah, and
in him all Israel, does not receive the promise of a single king, but of the kingdom
which shall at last be consummated in the Shiloh. 4. In favour of this general interpretation
is also ver. 19, in which the words, &quot;And dominion shall come out of Jacob,&quot; or
literally, &quot;They shall rule out of Jacob,&quot; may be considered as just a commentary
on the words, &quot;A sceptre riseth out of Israel.&quot; So also is ver. 7, &quot;More elevated
than Agag be his king,&quot; where the king of Israel is an <i>ideal</i> person&mdash;the personification
of the kingdom. Agag, <i>i.e.</i>, the fiery one, is not a proper name, but a surname
of all Amalekite kings. The Amalekite kingdom&mdash;which here represents the world&#39;s
power, opposed to the kingdom of God, because at the time of the Seer the Amalekites
were the most powerful among the people who were hostile to Israel (compare ver.
20, where they are called the <i>beginning</i> of the heathen nations, <i>i.e.</i>,
the most powerful of them)&mdash;is here put in opposition to the Israelitish kingdom,
and the latter will show itself superior to all worldly power.</p>
<p class="normal">The arguments which thus prove the reference of Balaam&#39;s prophecy
to an Israelitish kingdom, disprove also, not only the exclusive reference to David,
but also the exclusive reference to Christ; although they imply at the same time
that the prophecy, in its final reference, has Christ for its subject. The Israelitish
kingdom, indeed, attained to the full height of its destiny only in and with the
Messiah; without the Messiah, the Israelitish kingdom is a trunk without a head.
The prophecy thus centres in Christ. We are, however, not entitled to suppose that
the prophet himself was not aware of this; on the contrary, we cannot but assume
that Balaam must have known it. It is with intention that he does not speak of a
plurality of Israelitish kings. The Israelitish kingdom, on the contrary, appears
to him in the from of an <i>ideal</i> king, because he knows that, at some period,
it will find Its full realization in the person of one king. For the same reason,
Moses also describes the prophetic order, in the first instance, as an <i>ideal</i>
prophet. That Balaam knew that the Israelitish kingdom would centre in the Messiah,
is shown by the reference which his prophecy has to that of dying Jacob, in Gen.
xlix. 10, from which the figure of the sceptre is borrowed. According to the latter
passage, the whole dignity of Judah as <span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span> ruler
and lord over the whole heathen world is to centre in one elevated individual&mdash;the
Shiloh. As to the letter, Balaam&#39;s prophecy falls short of the prophecy to which
it refers, and on which it is founded, in two points. Instead of Judah, it mentions
Israel; and instead of the invincible kingdom which is at last to centre in the
Messiah, it represents the invincible kingdom only in general. But in both cases,
this generality is easily accounted for by the <i>external</i> direction of Balaam&#39;s
prophecy: a more definite tendency was of importance only for those who were <i>
within</i>. We are fully entitled to suppose that Balaam himself knew what was contained
in the fundamental passage. To the same result we are led by the contents of the
prophecy itself. Balaam here brings into view an Israelitish kingdom, all-powerful
on earth, and raised absolutely above the world&#39;s power. He does not stop with the
victory over Moab and Edom&mdash;even this victory appears to him as an absolute and lasting
one, and hence, essentially different from the temporary submission to David&mdash;but,
from the particular, which only serves to exemplify the idea in reference to the
historical relations existing at the present, he passes on, in ver. 19, to the general,
the total overthrow of the whole hostile world&#39;s power. Indeed, such a progress
is probably found even in ver. 17 itself. If at the close of it we read, &quot;And destroyeth
all the sons of the tumult,&quot; the word <i>all</i>, which is wanting in Jer. xlviii.
45, indicates that by the sons of the tumult we are to understand not only the Moabites,
but the whole <i>species</i> to which they belonged, the whole heathen world, whose
nature is restlessness, desire for strife, and the spirit of conquest,&mdash;the opposites
of meekness and gentleness, which are the virtues characteristic of the subjects
of the kingdom of God. In ver. 18, the particular is likewise followed by the general.
But while ver. 17 and 18 contain, in each of the two particular features, a previous
short allusion to the general, ver. 19 most expressly and intentionally reduces
the particular to the general. The absolute elevation above the world&#39;s power, attributed
by Balaam to the Israelitish kingdom, leads not only beyond the idea of a single
king of the ordinary stamp, but also beyond that of the entire ordinary kingdom.</p>
<p class="normal">The objections urged against the Messianic interpretation are
based either on a misunderstanding, or upon a superficial view of the passage. They
who maintain that the judging activity of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
the Messiah is here brought forward in a manner too one-sided, forget that this
part only could here be treated of. As Balaam&#39;s discourse formed the answer to Balak&#39;s
message&mdash;&quot;Come, curse me this people; peradventure we shall prevail to smite them
and drive them out of the land,&quot;&mdash;its natural subject was: <i>Israel&#39;s position towards
their enemies</i>; and Balaam had expressly stated, in ver. 14, that he would treat
of that subject. Balaam had to do with an enemy of Israel, and his chief aim was
to represent to him the vanity of all his hostile efforts. The partial view arises,
therefore, from the nature of the case; and only <i>in that case</i> could doubts
arise as to the ultimate reference to the Messiah, if the other view were altogether
<i>denied</i>. But such is by no means the case; for the words in ver. 9, &quot;Blessed
is he that blesseth thee,&quot; distinctly point it out. They who object to the Messianic
interpretation on the ground that, at the time of Christ, the Moabites had disappeared
from the stage of history, overlook the circumstance, that the Moabites here, as
well as in Is. xi., where the complete destruction of Moab is likewise assigned
to the times of the Messiah, are viewed only in their character as enemies to the
congregation of God. If the prophecy were fulfilled upon the Moabites, even at the
time when they still existed as a nation, not as Moabites, but as the enemies of
the people of God; then the limit of their national existence cannot be the limit
of the fulfilment of the prophecy. A case quite analogous is found in Mic. v. 4,
5, where the prophet characterizes the enemies of the kingdom of God at the time
of the Messiah by the name of Asshur, although it appears, from other passages,
that he distinctly knew that Asshur must, long ere that time, have disappeared from
the scene of history.</p>
<p class="normal">The Messianic character of the prophecy being thus established,
it will be impossible to misunderstand the internal relation between the star of
Balaam and the star of the wise men from the East. The star of Balaam is the emblem
of the kingdom which will rise in Israel. The star of the Magi is the symbol of
the Ruler in whom the kingly power appears concentrated. The appearance of the star
embodying the image of the prophet, indicates that the last and highest fulfilment
of his prophecies is now to take place.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_104" href="#div2Ref_104">MOSES&#39; PROMISE OF THE PROPHET.</a></h2>
<h3>(Deut. xviii. 15-19.)</h3>
<p class="normal">Ver. 15. &quot;<i>A prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,</i>
<i>like unto me, Jehovah thy God will raise up: unto him ye shall hearken.</i> Ver.
16. <i>According to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in the

him.</i> Ver. 19. <i>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">If we leave out of view the unfortunate attempts of those who
would understand by the prophet here promised, either Joshua&mdash;as is done by <i>Abenezra</i>,
<i>Bechai</i>, and <i>von Ammon</i> (<i>Christol</i>. S. 29)&mdash;or Jeremiah&mdash;as is the
case in <i>Baal Hatturim</i> and <i>Jalkut</i> out of the book <i>Pesikta</i>, and
in <i>Abarbanel</i>&mdash;we may reduce the expositions of this passage to three classes.
1. Several consider the &quot;prophet&quot; as a collective noun, and understand thereby the
prophets of all times. Such was the opinion of <i>Origen</i> (<i>c. Celsum</i> i.
9, § 5, <i>Mosh.</i>), of the Arabic translator, and of most of the modern Jewish
interpreters,&mdash;especially <i>Kimchi</i>, <i>Alshech</i>, and <i>Lipman</i> (<i>Nizachon</i>
137); while <i>Abenezra</i> and <i>Bechai</i> conjoin this view with that according
to which Jeremiah is meant. Among recent expositors, it is defended by <i>Rosenmüller</i>,
<i>Vater</i>, <i>Baumgarten-Crusius</i> (<i>Bibl. Theol.</i> S. 369), and others.
2. Some see in it an exclusive reference to Christ,&mdash;a view which has been held by
most interpreters in the Christian Church, and from the earliest times. It is found
as early as in <i>Justin Martyr</i>, <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Athanasius</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>
(<i>Demonstr.</i> iii. 2, ix. 11), <i>Lactantius</i> (iv. 17), <i>Augustine</i>
(<i>c. Faustum</i>, xvi. c. 15, 18, 19), and <i>Isidore</i> of <i>Pelusium</i> (c.
iii. ep. 49). It was held by <i>Luther</i> (t. 3. <i>Jen. Lat.</i> f. 123), became
the prevailing one in the Lutheran Church, and was <span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
approved of by most of the Reformed interpreters. Among its earliest defenders,
the most eminent are <i>Deyling</i> (<i>Misc.</i> ii. 175), <i>Frischmuth</i> (in
the <i>Thesaurus theol.-philol.</i> i. 354), and <i>Hasaeus</i> (in the <i>Thes.
theol.-philol.</i> nov. i. S. 439.) In recent times it has been defended by <i>Pareau</i>
(in the <i>Inst. interpr. V. T.</i> p. 506), by <i>Knapp</i> (<i>Dogm.</i> ii. 138).
3. Others have steered a middle course, inasmuch as they consider the &quot;prophet&quot;
to be a collective noun, but, at the same time, maintain that only by the mission
of Christ, in whom the idea of the prophetic order was perfectly realized, the promise
was completely fulfilled. Thus did <i>Nicolaus de Lyra</i>, <i>Calvin</i>, several
Roman Catholic interpreters, <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Clericus</i>, and others.</p>
<p class="normal">In favour of the Messianic interpretation, the authority of tradition
has been, first of all, appealed to. It is true that modern Jewish interpreters
differ from it; but this has been the result of polemical considerations alone.
It can be satisfactorily proved that the Messianic interpretation was the prevailing
one among the older Jews. 1 Mac. xiv. 41&mdash;&quot;Also that the Jews and priests resolved
that Simon should be commander and high priest for ever, until a <i>credible prophet</i>
should arise,&quot;&mdash;has been frequently appealed to in proof of this, but erroneously.
For, that by the &quot;credible prophet,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, one sufficiently attested by miracles
or fulfilled prophecies, we are not to understand the prophet promised by Moses
(as was done by Luther, and many older expositors who followed him), is shown, partly
by the absence of the article, and partly by the circumstance that a <i>credible</i>
prophet is spoken of. The sense is rather this: Simon and his family should continue
to hold the highest dignity until God Himself should make another arrangement by
a future prophet, as there was none at that time (comp. Ps. lxxiv. 9: &quot;There is
no more any prophet&quot;), and thus put an end to a state of things which, on the one
hand, was in contradiction to the law, and, on the other, to the promise,&mdash;a state
of things unto which they had been led by the force of circumstances, and which
could, at all events, be only a provisional one. (Compare <i>J. D. Michaelis</i>
on that passage.) It is not on the passage under review that the expectation of
a prophet there rests, but rather on Mal. iii. 1, 23, where a prophet is promised
as the precursor of the Messiah. But the New Testament furnishes sufficient materials
for proving the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span> Messianic interpretation.
The very manner in which Peter and Stephen quote this passage shows that the Messianic
interpretation was, at that time, the prevailing one. They do not deem it at all
necessary to prove it; they proceed on the supposition of its being universally
acknowledged. It was, no doubt, chiefly our passage which Philip had in view when,
in John i. 46, he said to Nathanael: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8003;&#957; &#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#949; &#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#8134;&#962;
&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#957;&#8057;&#956;&#8179; &#949;&#8017;&#961;&#8053;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;, &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;.</span> For, besides the passage under consideration,
there is only one other personal Messianic prophecy in the Pentateuch, namely, Gen.
xlix. 10; and the marks of the Shiloh did not so distinctly appear in Jesus, as
did those of the Prophet. The mention of the person of Moses<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_106a" href="#ftn_106a">[1]</a></sup>
(which in Gen. xlix. 10 is less concerned), and of the law, clearly point to the
passage under review. After the feeding of the five thousand, the people say, in
John vi. 14: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8013;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8182;&#962; &#8001; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962;, &#8001;
&#7952;&#961;&#967;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957;.</span> The Messianic interpretation was, accordingly,
not peculiar to a few learned men, but to the whole people. Even with the Samaritans
the Messianic explanation was the prevailing one,&mdash;based, no doubt, upon the tradition
which had come to them from the Jews. The Samaritan woman says, in John iv. 25:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#924;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#8001; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#962;&#903; &#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;
&#7956;&#955;&#952;&#8131; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945;.</span> Now, as the Samaritans acknowledged only
the Pentateuch, there is no other passage than that under review from which the
idea of the Messiah as a divinely enlightened teacher, which is here expressed,
could have been derived. The last words agree in a remarkable manner with Deut.
xviii. 18: &quot;And he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.&quot; That too
great weight, however, must not be attached to tradition, is shown by John i. 21,
and vii. 40, 41; for these passages clearly prove that there were also many who
thought it possible that Deut. xviii. contained not only the announcement of the
Messiah, but of some distinguished prophet also, besides Him, who should be His
precursor or companion. At the same time, we must not overlook the circumstance
that, in both passages, the people are at a loss, and are thereby induced to deviate
from the prevailing <span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span> opinion. Their uncertainty
and wavering, however, is only about the person. In this they agree, notwithstanding,
that in Deut. xviii. they find the announcement of one distinguished person.</p>
<p class="normal">But the Messianic interpretation may appeal, with still greater
confidence, to the direct evidence of the New Testament. The declaration of the

must here have had in view a distinct passage of the Pentateuch,&mdash;a clear and definite
declaration of Moses. Dexterous explanations (<i>Bengel</i>: <i>Nunquam non</i>;
<i>Tholuck</i>: The prophetical and typical element implied in the whole form of
worship) are of no apologetic value, and it is not possible summarily, on such grounds,
to call the enemies before the judgment-seat of God. It was not enough to allude,
in a way so general, to what could not be at once perceptible; greater distinctness
and particularity would have been required. But if a single declaration&mdash;a direct
Messianic prophecy&mdash;form the question at issue, our passage only can be meant; for
it is the only prophecy of Christ which Moses, on whose person great stress is laid,
uttered in his own name. Moreover, Christ would more readily expect that the Jews
would acknowledge our prophecy to be fulfilled in Him, than the prophecy in Gen.
xlix., which refers rather to the Messiah in glory. The preceding words of Jesus
likewise contain references to the passage now under consideration. Ver. 38&mdash;&quot;And
ye have not His word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not,&quot;&mdash;contains
an allusion to Deut. xviii. 18: &quot;And I will put My words into his mouth, and he
shall speak unto them all that I shall command him;&quot; so that whosoever rejects the
Ambassador of God, rejects His word at the same time. John v. 43&mdash;&quot;I am come in My
Father&#39;s name, and ye receive Me not,&quot;&mdash;acquires both its significance and earnestness
from its reference to ver. 19 of our passage: &quot;Whosoever will not hearken unto My
words, which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him.&quot; <i>Further</i>,&mdash;The
point at issue in this discourse of Christ is an accusation of the Jews against
Christ, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span> that He had violated the Mosaic law.
(Compare John v. 10-16, and v. 18, which states the second apparent violation of
the law.) It was thus highly appropriate that Jesus should throw back upon the Jews
the charge which they brought against Him, and should prove to them that it was
just they who were in fatal opposition to the enactments of the Mosaic law. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;It
is this same Moses in whom they trusted, whom they considered as their patron, and
whom to please the more, they were so zealous for his law against Jesus,&mdash;it is this
same Moses whom Jesus represents as their accuser. And he is such an accuser as
renders every other superfluous, so that Christ did not need specially to come forward
in such a character. The accusation of Moses must, then, according to this declaration,
and in accordance with what follows, refer to the cause of Christ. But the passage
under review is the only Messianic prophecy of a <i>threatening character</i> which
the Pentateuch contains,&mdash;the only one in which divine judgments are threatened to
the despisers of the Messiah,&mdash;the only Mosaic foundation for the denunciation: &quot;Woe
to the people that despiseth thee.&quot; If it be denied that Christ refers to it,&mdash;if
its Messianic character be not acknowledged, the first words of Christ are destitute
of foundation. But if it be thus undeniable that Christ declared Himself to be the
prophet of our passage, it must be considered an indirect attack upon His divinity
to say, as <i>Dr Lücke</i> does, that Christ did so by way of &quot;adaptation to the
interpretation of that time.&quot; It is just this appeal which forms the pith of Christ&#39;s
discourse; it is the real death-blow inflicted by Him upon His adversaries. If this
blow was a mere feint, His honour is endangered,&mdash;which may God forbid!&mdash;The Lord
further marks Himself out as the prophet announced by Moses, and that, too, in a
very distinct manner, in John xii. 48-50,&mdash;a passage which is evidently based upon
vers. 18 and 19 of the text under review. (Compare John xiv. 24-31.)&mdash;To this we
may add, further, that, according to St Luke xxiv. 44, the Lord Himself explains
to His disciples the prophecies in the Pentateuch concerning Him; and we cannot
well expect that Christ should have made no reference to a passage which one of
the Apostles points out as being of greater weight than all others. This is done
by Peter in Acts iii. 22, 23. The manner in which he quotes it, entirely excludes
the notion that Moses was <span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span> speaking of Christ,
only in so far as He belonged to the collective body of the prophets. Peter says
expressly, that Moses and the later prophets foretold
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span>; and the words,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span>, show that he did not
understand the singular in a collective sense. The circumstance that Stephen, in
Acts vii. 37, likewise refers the passage to Christ, would not be, in itself, conclusive,
because Stephen&#39;s case is different from that of the Apostles. But we must not overlook
the passage Matt. xvii. 5, according to which, at Christ&#39;s transfiguration, a voice
was heard from heaven which said: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#8057;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#8057;&#962;
&#956;&#959;&#965; &#8001; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#962;, &#7952;&#957; &#8103; &#949;&#8016;&#948;&#8057;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#903; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#8059;&#949;&#964;&#949;.</span> As the first part of this declaration
is taken from the Messianic prediction in Is. xlii., so is the second from the passage
under consideration; and, by this use of its words, the sense is clearly shown.
It is a very significant fact, that our passage is thus connected just with Is.
xlii.&mdash;the first prophetic announcement in which it is specially resumed, and in
which the prophetic order itself is the proclaimer of <i>the</i> Prophet. And it
is not less significant that this reference to our text, with which all the other
announcements by Isaiah concerning the Great Prophet to come are so immediately
connected, should precede chapters xlix., l., and lxi. It thus serves as a commentary
upon the declaration of Moses. The beginning and the outlines receive light from
the progress and completion. </p>
<p class="normal">He, however, who believes in Christ, will, after these details,
expect that internal reasons also should prove the reference to Christ; and this
expectation is fully confirmed.</p>
<p class="normal">That Moses did not intend by the word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;</span> &quot;prophet,&quot; to designate a collective
body merely, but that he had at least some special individual in view, appears,
partly, from the word itself being constantly in the singular, and, partly, from
the constant use of the singular suffixes in reference to it; while, in the case
of collective nouns, it is usual to interchange the singular with the plural. The
force of this argument is abundantly evident in the fact, that not a few of even
non-Messianic interpreters have been thereby compelled to make some single individual
the subject of this prophecy. But we must hesitate the more to adopt the opinion
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;</span> stands here simply in the singular
instead of the plural, because neither does this word anywhere else occur as a collective
noun, nor is the prophetic order ever <span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span> spoken
of in the manner alleged. The expectation of a Messiah was already at that time
current among the people. In what way, then, could they understand a promise, in
which one individual only was spoken of, except by referring it, at least chiefly,
to the one whom they expected?&mdash;<i>Hofmann</i> (<i>Weissagung und Erfüllung</i> i.
S. 253) objects that the prophet here spoken of was, in no respect, different from
the <i>king</i> in Deut. xvii. 14-20. But the king mentioned there is no collective
noun. An individual who, in future times, should first attain to royal dignity,
forms there the subject throughout. This appears especially from ver. 20, where
he and his <i>sons</i> are spoken of. The first king is held up as an example, to
show in him what was applicable to the royal dignity in general. On the other hand,
it is in favour of our view, that, in the verses immediately preceding (vers. 8-13),
the priests are, at first, spoken of only in the plural, although the priestly order
had much more of the character of a collective body than the prophetic order.</p>
<p class="normal">A comparison between this prophecy and that of the Shiloh in Gen.
xlix. 10 is likewise in favour of the Messianic interpretation. Even there. His
prophetic office is alluded to in the kingly office. The ruler out of Judah is the
Peaceful One, to whom the nations yield a spontaneous obedience, an obedience flowing
from a pious source,&mdash;and He rules not by compulsion, but by the word.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophet is moreover contrasted with a single individual&mdash;with
Moses; and this compels us to refer the prophecy to some distinguished individual.
In ver. 15, Moses promises to the people a prophet <i>like unto himself</i>; and
thus also does the Lord say, in ver. 18: &quot;A prophet <i>like unto thee</i> I will
raise up.&quot; We cannot for a moment suppose that this likeness should refer to the
prophetic calling only,&mdash;to the words: &quot;I will put My words into his mouth, and he
shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.&quot; It must at the same time be
implied in it, that the future prophet shall be as thoroughly competent for his
work, as Moses was for that which was committed to him. If it were not so, the promise
would be deficient in that consolatory and elevating character which, according
to the context, it is evidently intended to possess. If we were to paraphrase thus,
&quot;The Lord will raise up a prophet, inferior, indeed, to myself,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span> but yet the bearer of divine revelations,&quot;
we should at once perceive how unsuitable it were. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;It is quite evident
that the &quot;Prophet&quot; here is the main instrument of divine agency among the covenant-people
of the future,&mdash;that He is the real support and anchor of the kingdom of God. But
now the difficulties of the future were, as Moses himself saw, so great, that gifts
in any way short of those of Moses would by no means have been sufficient. Moses
foresees that the spirit of apostasy, which, even in his time, began to manifest
itself, would, in future times, increase to a fearful extent. (Compare especially
Deut. xxxii.) Against this, ordinary gifts and powers would be of no avail. A successful
and enduring reaction could be brought about only by one who should be, for the
more difficult circumstances of the future, such as Moses was for his times. But&mdash;and
this circumstance is of still greater weight&mdash;it forms the task of the future to
translate the whole heathen world into the kingdom of God. In it, Japheth is to
dwell in the tents of Shem; all the nations of the earth are to become partakers
in the blessing resting on Abraham. In the view of such a task, a prophet of ordinary
dimensions, as well as the collective body of such, would dwindle down to the appearance
of a dwarf. They would have been less than Moses. In Deut. xxxiv. 10, it is said,
&quot;There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face
to face;&quot;&mdash;a passage which not only plainly refers to the experience acquired at
that time, but which expresses also what might be expected of that portion of the
future which was more immediately at hand. When Miriam and Aaron said, &quot;Doth the
Lord indeed speak only by Moses, doth He not speak by us also?&quot; the Lord immediately,
Num. xii. 6-8, reproves their presumption of thinking themselves <i>like unto Moses</i>,
as respects the prophetical gift, in these words: &quot;If some one be your prophet,&quot;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
if some one be a prophet according to your way, with prophets of your class,&mdash;&quot;I,
the Lord, make myself known unto him in a vision, in a dream I speak unto him. Not
so my servant Moses; in all My house he is faithful. Mouth to mouth I speak to him,
and face to face, and not in dark speeches; and the appearance of the Lord he beholds.&quot;
Moses, as a prophet, is here contrasted with the whole order of prophets of ordinary
gifts. A higher dignity among them is claimed for him on the ground that not some
special mission, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span> but the care of the whole
economy of the Old Testament, was entrusted to him; compare Heb. iii. 5. His is
a specially close relation to the Lord, a specially high degree of illumination.
The collective body of ordinary prophets cannot, therefore, by any possibility be
the &quot;prophet&quot; who is <i>like unto Moses</i>, as completely equal to the task of
the future as Moses was for that of his day. But the greater the work of the future,
the more necessary is it that the prophet of the future, in order to be <i>like
unto Moses</i>, should, in his whole individuality, and in all his gifts, be far
superior to him; compare Heb. iii. 6.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Finally</i>,&mdash;The common prophetic order itself refuses the
honour of being the prophet like unto Moses. The prophecies of Isaiah, in chapters
xlii., xlix., l., and lxi., are based upon our passage, and in all of them the Messiah
appears as the prophet <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>. It is to
Him that the mission is entrusted of being the restorer of Jacob, and the salvation
of the Lord, even unto the end of the world.</p>
<p class="normal">Whilst these reasons demand the reference of this prophecy to
Christ, there are, on the other hand, weighty considerations which make it appear
that a reference to the prophetic order of the Old Testament cannot be excluded.
These considerations are, 1. The wider context. Deuteronomy is distinguished from
the preceding books by this, that provisions are made in it for the time subsequent
to the death of Moses, which was now at hand. From chap. xvii. 8, the magistrates
and powers&mdash;the superiors, to whose authority in secular and spiritual affairs the
people shall submit&mdash;are introduced. First, the civil magistrates are brought before
them, xvii. 8-20; and then the ecclesiastical superiors, chap. xviii. Vers. 1-8
treat of the priests as the ordinary servants of the Lord in spiritual things. Everywhere
else, offices, institutions, orders, are spoken of. In such a connection, it is
not probable that <i>the prophet</i> should be only an individual; and the less
so, because evidently the prophet, as the organ of the immediate revelation of God,
is placed by the side of the priests, the teachers of the law (compare xvii. 10,
11, 18; xxxiv. 10), as their corrective, as a thorn in their flesh, to make up for
their inability. It is true that this wider connection is also against those who
would here <i>exclude</i> Christ. If it be certain that Moses already knew the Messianic
promises (compare the remarks on Gen. xlix.), then, just in this context, the reference
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span> to Christ, the head of the authorities of
the future, could not be wanting.</p>
<p class="normal">2. An exclusive reference to Christ is opposed by the more immediate
context. This connection is twofold. In ver. 15, Moses first utters the promise
in his own name, and here it stands connected with what precedes. Moses had forbidden
to the people the use of all the means by which those who were given to idolatry
endeavoured to penetrate the boundaries of human knowledge: &quot;Thou shalt not do so,&quot;
is his language; for that which these are vainly seeking after in this sinful manner,
shall, in reality, be granted to thee by thy God. Here, it was not only appropriate
to remind them of the Messiah, inasmuch as His appearance, as being the most perfect
revelation of God, satisfies most perfectly the desire after higher communications;
but it would have been very strange if here, where so suitable an opportunity presented
itself, the founder of the Old Economy had omitted all reference to the founder
of the New Economy, and had limited himself to the intervening, more imperfect divine
communications. But, on the other hand, it would have been as strange if Moses had
taken no notice of them at all,&mdash;if, supposing that a series of false prophets would
appear, he had been satisfied to lay down in chap. xiii. 2 sqq. the distinctive
marks of true and false prophets, and had then, in the passage under review, referred
to the divine revelations to be expected in the distant future, without noticing
those to be expected in the more immediate future,&mdash;thus neglecting to employ means
peculiarly fitted for gaining admission for his exhortations. The word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;</span> in ver. 14 is especially opposed to such
a view. &quot;And thou (shalt) not (do) so, Jehovah thy God gave thee.&quot; <i>J. D. Michaelis</i>
says: &quot;What He gave to the Israelites is specified in vers. 15 and 18.&quot; The past
tense suggests the idea of a gift which had already taken its beginning in the present.&mdash;The
promise stands in a different connection in ver. 18. Moses had already given it
in his own name in ver. 15. In order to give it greater authority, he reports, in
the following verses, when and how he had received it from God. It was delivered
to him on Sinai, where God had directly revealed Himself to the people at the promulgation
of the Law, partly in order to strengthen their confidence in Moses the mediator,
and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span> partly to show them the folly of their
desiring any other mode of divine communication. But the people were seized with
terror before the dreadful majesty of God, and prayed that God would no longer speak
to them directly, but through a mediator, as He had hitherto done; compare Exod.
xx.; Deut. v. The Lord then said to Moses, &quot;They have well spoken; a prophet,&quot; etc.
The words here, in ver. 17, agree very well with Deut. v. 28. The agreement in the
words indicates that <i>here</i> we have an addition to that which is <i>there</i>
communicated regarding what was spoken by God on that occasion. <i>There</i>, we
are told only what had an immediate reference to the present&mdash;viz., the appointment
of Moses as mediator; <i>here</i>, we are told what was at that time fixed in reference
to the future of the people. We cannot fail to perceive that <i>here</i>, if ever,
a divine revelation was appropriate concerning the coming of Christ, who, as the
Mediator between God and man, veiled His Godhead, and in human form, brought God
nearer to man. But we should, at the same time, expect here an allusion to the inferior
messengers of God, who were to precede Him.</p>
<p class="normal">3. The exclusive reference to the Messiah is inconsistent with
vers. 20-22. The marks of a false prophet are given in them. If, however, that which
precedes had no reference at all to true prophets, it would be almost impossible
to trace any suitable connection of the thoughts.</p>
<p class="normal">4. If the passage were referred to Christ exclusively, the prophetic
institution would then be without any legitimate authority; and from the whole character
of the Mosaic legislation, as laying the foundation for the future progress and
development of the Theocracy, we could not well conceive that so important an institution
should be deficient in this point. Moreover, the whole historical existence of the
prophetic order necessarily presupposes such a foundation. Deut. xiii. 2 sq. was
not fitted to afford such a foundation, as it refers, only indirectly and by implication,
to true prophets.</p>
<p class="normal">5. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;There are not wanting slight hints in the New
Testament that the reference to Christ is not an exclusive one. These are found
in Luke xi. 50, 51: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7997;&#957;&#945; &#7952;&#954;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#952;&#8135; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7991;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957; ... &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8118;&#962; &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#962; ... &#957;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#8051;&#947;&#969; &#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8118;&#962;
&#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#962;.</span> The emphatic repetition of <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>
in that passage shows plainly its connection <span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>
with the words, &quot;I will require it of him,&quot; in the passage under review; just as
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;</span>, which, according to 2 Chron. xxiv.
22, the prophet Zechariah, who was unjustly slain, uttered when dying, alludes not
only to Gen. ix. 5, but to our passage also. But here we must remark that, in consequence
of the sin committed against the Prophet <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>&mdash;Christ&mdash;vengeance
for the crimes committed against the inferior prophets is executed at the same time,
so that, in the first instance, <i>His</i> blood is required, and, on this occasion,
all the blood also which was formerly shed.</p>
<p class="normal">But how can these two facts be reconciled:&mdash;that Moses had, undeniably,
the Messiah in view, and that, notwithstanding, there seems at the same time to
be a reference to the prophets in general? The simplest mode of reconciling them
is the following. The prophet here is an <i>ideal</i> person, comprehending all
the true prophets who had appeared from Moses to Christ, including the latter. But
Moses does not here speak of the prophets as a collective body, to which, at the
close, Christ also belonged, as it were, incidentally, and as one among the many,&mdash;as
<i>Calvin</i> and other interpreters mentioned above suppose; but rather, the plurality
of prophets is, for this reason only, comprehended by Moses in an <i>ideal</i> unity,
that, on the authority of Gen. xlix. 10, and by the illumination of the Holy Spirit,
he knew that the prophetical order would, at some future time, centre in a real
person,&mdash;in Christ. But there is so much the more of truth in thus viewing the prophetic
order as a whole, since, according to 1 Peter i. 11, the Spirit of Christ spoke
in the prophets. Thus, in a certain sense, Christ is the only Prophet.</p>

its results cannot be otherwise than very meagre and unsatisfactory. Wheresoever
the true state of human nature is seen in the light of Holy Scripture, no high expectations
can be entertained from a merely human Saviour, although he were endowed even with
as full a measure of the gifts of the Spirit of God as human nature, in its finite
and sinful condition, is able to bear. But unless there exist in the one divine
Being itself, such a distinction of persons, the divinity of the Saviour cannot
be acknowledged, without endangering the unity of God which the Scriptures so emphatically
teach. If, however, there be such a distinction,&mdash;if the Word be indeed with God,
we cannot avoid ascribing to God the desire of revealing Himself; nor, in such a
case, can we conceive that He should content Himself with inferior forms of revelation,
with merely transitory manifestations. We can recognise in these only preparations,
and preludes of the highest and truest revelation.</p>
<p class="normal">The question then is, whether any insight into this doctrine is
to be found as early as in the Books of the Old Testament. Sound Christian Theology
has discovered the outlines of such a distinction betwixt the hidden and the revealed
God, in many passages of the Old Testament, in which mention is made of the Angel
or Messenger of God. The general tenor of these passages will be best exemplified
by the first among them,&mdash;the narrative of Hagar in Gen. xvi. In ver. 7, we are told
that the Angel of Jehovah found Hagar. In ver. 10, this Angel ascribes to Himself
a divine work, viz., the innumerable increase of Hagar&#39;s posterity. In ver. 11,
He says that Jehovah had heard her distress. He thus asserts of Jehovah what, shortly
before. He had said of Himself. Moreover, in ver. 13, Hagar expresses her astonishment
that she had seen God, and yet had remained alive.&mdash;The opinion that these passages
form the Old Testament foundation for the Proemium of St John&#39;s Gospel, has not
remained uncontroverted. From the very times of the Church-fathers it has been asserted
by many, that where the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span> Angel of the Lord
is spoken of, we must not think of a person connected with God by unity of nature,
but of a lower angel, by whom God executes His commands, and through whom He acts
and speaks. The latest defenders of the view are <i>Hofmann</i> in &quot;<i>Weissagung
und Erfüllung</i>&quot; and in the &quot;<i>Schriftbeweis</i>&quot; and <i>Delitzsch</i> in his
commentary on Genesis.&mdash;Others are of opinion, that the Angel of Jehovah is identical
with Jehovah Himself,&mdash;not denoting a person distinct from Him, but only the form
in which He manifests Himself. We shall not here discuss the question in its whole
extent; we shall, in the meantime, consider only what the principal passages of
the Pentateuch and of the adjacent Book of Joshua teach upon this point, and how
far their teaching coincides with, or is in opposition to, these various views.
For it is only to this extent that the inquiry belongs to our present object.</p>
<p class="normal">In <a name="div2_117" href="#div2Ref_117">Gen. xvi. 13</a>, these
words are of special importance: &quot;<i>And she called the name of the Lord who spoke
unto her, Thou art a God of sight: for she said, Do I now</i> (properly <i>here</i>,
in the place where such a sight was vouchsafed to me) <i>still see after my seeing?</i>&quot;
&quot;Do I see&quot; is equivalent to, &quot;Do I live,&quot; because death threatened, as it were,
to enter through the eyes. (Compare the expression, &quot;Mine eyes have seen,&quot; in Is.
vi.) <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</span> is the pausal form for
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1459;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</span>; see Job xxxiii. 21, where, however,
the accent is on the penultimate. Then follows ver. 14: <i>They called the well</i>,
&quot;<i>Well of the living sight</i>;&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, where a person had a sight of God,
and remained alive.</p>
<p class="normal">Hagar must have been convinced that she had seen God without the
mediation of a created angel; for, otherwise, she could not have wondered that her
life was preserved. Man, entangled by the visible world, is terrified when he comes
in contact with the invisible world, even with angels. (Compare Dan. viii. 17, 18;
Luke ii. 9.) But this terror rises to fear of death only when man comes into contact
with the Lord Himself. (Compare the remarks on Rev. i. 17.) In Gen. xxxii. 31&mdash;a
passage which bears the closest resemblance to the one now under review, and from
which it receives its explanation&mdash;it is said: &quot;And Jacob called the name of the
place <i>Peniel</i>, for I have seen <span class="sc">God</span> face to face, and
my life has been preserved.&quot; In Exod. xx. 19, the children of Israel said to Moses,
&quot;Speak thou with us, and we will hear; and let not God speak with us,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span> lest we die;&quot; compared with Deut. v. 21: &quot;Now
therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the
voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die.&quot; (Compare also Deut. xviii.
16.) And it is Jehovah who, in Exod. xxxiii. 20, says, &quot;There shall no man see Me
and live.&quot; Israel&#39;s Lord and God is, in the absolute energy of His nature, a &quot;consuming
fire,&quot; Deut. iv. 24. (Compare Deut. ix. 3; Is. xxxiii. 14: &quot;Who among us would dwell
with the devouring fire? who among us would dwell with everlasting burning?&quot; Heb.
xii. 29.) It is not the reflected light, even in the most exalted creatures, nor
the sight of the saints of whom it is said, &quot;Behold, He puts no trust in His servants,
and His angels He chargeth with folly,&quot;&mdash;but the sight of the thrice Holy One, which
makes Isaiah exclaim, &quot;Woe is me, for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips,
and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">So much then is clear,&mdash;that the opinion which considers the Angel
of the Lord to be a created angel is overthrown by the first passage where that
angel is mentioned, if the exposition which we have given of vers. 13, 14&mdash;an exposition
which is now generally received, and which was last advanced by <i>Knobel</i>&mdash;be
correct. But <i>Delitzsch</i> gives another exposition: &quot;Thou art a God of sight,&quot;<!--removed quote mark; see p. 221 of Biblical Commentary on the
Old Testament, v. 1, by Keil and Delitzsch, 1866--> <i>i.e.</i>, one whose all-seeing
eye does not overlook the helpless and destitute, even in the remotest corner of
the wilderness.&quot; Against this we remark, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;</span>
never denotes the act of seeing, but the sight itself. &quot;Have I not even here (even
in the desert land of destitution) looked after Him who saw me?&quot; &quot;Well of the living
one who seeth me,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, of the omnipresent divine providence. In opposition
to this exposition, however, we must remark, that God is nowhere else in Genesis
called the Living One. But our chief objection is, that these expositions destroy
the connection which so evidently exists between our passage and those already quoted,&mdash;especially
Gen. xxxii. 31; Exod. xxxiii. 20. (Compare, moreover, Jud. xiii. 22: &quot;And Manoah
said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen <span class="sc">God</span>.&quot;)</p>
<p class="normal">It has been asked. Why should the Logos have appeared first to
the Egyptian maid? But the low condition of Hagar cannot here come into consideration;
for the appearance is in reality intended, not for her, but for Abraham. Immediately
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span> before, in chap. xii. 7, it is said, &quot;And
the Lord appeared unto Abraham;&quot; and immediately after, in chap. xvii. 1, &quot;And when
Abraham was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to him;&quot; the appearance
of the Lord Himself is mentioned in order that every thought of a lower angel may
be warded off. The passage under consideration, then, contains the indication, that
such appearances must only be conceived of as manifestations of the Deity Himself
to the world. Just as our passage is preserved from erroneous interpretations by
such passages as Gen. xii. 7, xvii. 1, so these receive from ours, in return, their
most distinct definition. We learn from this, that wherever appearances of Jehovah
are mentioned, we must conceive of them as effected by the mediation of His Angel.
There is no substantial difference betwixt the passages in which Jehovah Himself
is mentioned, and those in which the Angel of Jehovah is spoken of. They serve to
supplement and to explain one another. The words, &quot;In His Angel,&quot; in chap. xvi.
7, furnish us with the supplement to the succeeding statement, &quot;And <i>Jehovah</i>
appeared to him&quot; (so, <i>e.g.</i>, also in chap. xviii. 1), just as the writer in
Gen. chap. ii. iii. makes use of the name Jehovah-Elohim, in order that henceforth
every one may understand that where only Jehovah is spoken of. He is yet personally
identical with Elohim.</p>
<p class="normal">Let us now turn to <a name="div2_119" href="#div2Ref_119">Gen.
xviii. xix.</a> According to <i>Delitzsch</i>. all the three men who appeared to
Abraham were &quot;finite spirits made visible.&quot; <i>Hofmann</i> (<i>Schriftb.</i> S.
87) says: &quot;Jehovah is present on earth in His angels, in the two with Lot, as in
the three with Abraham.&quot; We, however, hold fast by the view of the ancient Church,
that in chap. xviii. the Logos appeared accompanied by two inferior angels.</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">Abraham&#39;s regards are, from the very first, involuntarily
directed to one from among the three, and whom he addresses by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</span>, O Lord (xviii. 3); the two others
are considered by him as companions only. But Lot has to do with both equally, and
addresses them first by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;</span>, my Lords.&mdash;In
chap. xviii., it is always one only of the three who speaks; the two others are
mute;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_119a" href="#ftn_119a">[1]</a></sup> while
in chap. xix. everything comes from the two <span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>
equally. He with whom Abraham has to do, always, and without exception, speaks as
God Himself; while the two with whom Lot has to do speak at first, as
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, distinguishing themselves
from the Lord who sent them (compare ver. 13); and it is only after they have thus
drawn the line of separation between themselves and Jehovah, that they appear, in
vers. 21, 22, as speaking in His name. They do so, moreover, only after Lot, in
the anxiety of his heart and in his excitement, had previously addressed, in them,
Him who sent them, and with whom he desired to have to do as immediately as possible.
The scene bears, throughout, a character of excitement, and is not fitted to afford
data for general conclusions. We cannot infer from it that it was, in general, customary
to address, in the angels, the Lord who sent them, or that the angels acted in the
name of the Lord. In chap. xviii., from ver. 1, where the narrative begins with
the words, &quot;And Jehovah appeared unto him,&quot; Moses always speaks of him with whom
Abraham had to do as Jehovah only, excepting where he introduces the three men.
(He with whom Abraham has to do is called, not fewer than eight times, Jehovah,
and six times <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</span>.) But in chap. xix.,
Jehovah, who is concealed behind the two angels, appears only twice in the expression,
&quot;And He said,&quot; in vers. 17, 21, for which ver. 13 suggests the supplement: &quot;through
His two angels.&quot;&mdash;Even in ver. 16, the narrative distinguishes Jehovah from the two
men,&mdash;and all this in an exciting scene which must have influenced even the narrator.
If he who spoke to Abraham was an angel like the other two, we could scarcely perceive
any reason why he should not have taken part in the mission to Sodom; but if he
was the Angel of the Lord <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>, the
reason is quite obvious; it would have been inconsistent with divine propriety.&mdash;In
chap. xviii. Moses speaks of three men; it is evidently on <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 121]</span> purpose that he avoids speaking of three angels. In chap. xix. 1,
on the contrary, we are at once told: &quot;And there came the two angels.&quot; (Compare
ver. 15.) The reason why in chap. xviii. the use of the name <i>angels</i> is avoided
can only be, because it might easily have led to a misunderstanding, if the Angel
of the Lord had been comprehended in that one designation along with the two inferior
angels, although it would not, in itself, have been inadmissible.&mdash;If we suppose
that he, with whom Abraham had to do, was some created angel, we cannot well understand
how, in chap. xviii. 17 seq., the judgment over Sodom could, throughout, be ascribed
to him. <i>He</i> could not, in the name of the Lord, speak of that judgment, as
not he, but the two other angels who went to Sodom, were the instruments of its
execution. Hence it only remains to ascribe the judgment to him as the <i>causa
principalis</i>.&mdash;If the three angels were equals, it would be impossible to explain
the adversative clause in chap. xviii. 22: &quot;And the men turned from thence and went
to Sodom; <i>but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.</i>&quot; Jehovah and the two angels
are here contrasted. It is true that, in the two angels also, it is Jehovah who
acts. This is evident from xviii. 21: &quot;I will go down and see&quot;&mdash;where the going down
does not refer to descending to the valley of Jordan, the position of which was
lower (thus <i>Delitzsch</i>); but, according to xi. 7, it refers to a descent from
heaven to earth. That Jehovah, though on earth, should declare His resolution to
go down, as in xi. 7, may be explained from the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8001;
&#8034;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#8183;</span> in John iii. 13. God, even when He is on earth, remains in
heaven, and it is thence that He manifests Himself. Moreover, the words immediately
following show in what sense this going down is to be understood,&mdash;that it is not
in His own person, but through the medium of His messengers. The resolution, &quot;I
will go down,&quot; is carried into effect by the going down of the angels to Sodom.</p>
<p class="normal">By the Jehovah who, from Jehovah out of heaven, caused brimstone
and fire to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah (xix. 24), we are not at liberty to understand
the two angels only,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_121a" href="#ftn_121a">[2]</a></sup>
but, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span> agreeably to the views of sound Christian
expositors generally, Christ,&mdash;with this modification, however, that the two angels
are to be considered as His servants, and that what they do is His work also. It
is true that the angels say, in xix. 13, &quot;We will destroy,&quot; etc.; but much more
emphatically and frequently does he with whom Abraham has to do, ascribe the work
of destruction to himself. (Compare xviii. 17, where Jehovah says, &quot;How can I hide
from Abraham that thing which I am doing?&quot; vers. 24-28, etc.) If in xix. 24 there
be involved the contrast between, so to speak, the heavenly and earthly Jehovah,&mdash;between
the hidden God and Him who manifests Himself on earth,&mdash;then so much the more must
we seek the latter in chap. xviii., as in ver. 22, compared with ver. 21, the angels
are distinctly pointed out as His Messengers.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Delitzsch</i> asserts that in Heb. xiii. 2, the words,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#8057;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962; &#958;&#949;&#957;&#8055;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>, clearly indicate
that &quot;all three were finite spirits made visible.&quot; This assertion, however, which
was long before made by the Socinian <i>Crellius</i>, has been sufficiently refuted
by <i>Ode de Angelis</i>, p. 1001. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews intends
to connect the events which happened to Abraham and Lot equally&mdash;<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>;
and for this reason he did not go beyond what was common to them both. Moreover,
the Angel of the Lord is likewise comprehended in the appellation &quot;<i>angels</i>,&quot;
for the name has no reference to the nature, but to the mission.</p>

<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">Of no less importance and significance is the passage
<a name="div2_122" href="#div2Ref_122">Gen. xxxi. 11 seq.</a> According to ver.
11, the Angel of God, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, appears
to Jacob in a dream. In ver. 13, the same person calls himself the God of Bethel,
with reference to the event recorded in chap. xxviii. 11-22. It cannot be supposed
that in chap xxviii. the mediation of a common angel took place, who, however, had
not been expressly mentioned; for Jehovah is there contrasted with the angels. In
ver. 12, we read: &quot;And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.&quot;
In ver. 13, there is another sight: &quot;And behold Jehovah stood by him and said, I
am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon
thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.&quot;</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span></p>
<p class="normal">This passage is also in so far of importance, because, agreeably
to what has been remarked in p. 119, it follows from it that even there, where Jehovah
simply is mentioned, the mediation through His Angel is to be assumed.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">He with whom Jacob wrestles, in
<a name="div2_123" href="#div2Ref_123">Gen. xxxii. 24</a>, makes himself known as
God, partly by giving him the name Israel, <i>i.e.</i>, one who wrestles with God,
and partly by bestowing a blessing upon him. Jacob calls the place <i>Peniel</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, face of God, because he had seen God face to face, and wonders that
his life was preserved. The answer which Elohim gives here to Jacob&#39;s question regarding
His name, remarkably coincides with that which in Judges xiii. 17, 18, is given
by <i>the</i> Angel of the Lord to a similar question. In Hosea xii. 4 (comp. the
remarks on this passage in the Author&#39;s &quot;<i>Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,&quot;
vol. i. p. 128 ff.), he who wrestled with Jacob is called Elohim, as in Genesis;
but in ver. 5, he is called <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;</span>, a word which
is more distinctly defined by the preceding Elohim; so that we can, accordingly,
think only of the Angel of God. As it was certainly not the intention of the prophet
to state a new historical circumstance, the mention of the Angel must be founded
upon the supposition, that all revelations of God are made by the mediation of His
Angel,&mdash;a supposition which we have already proved to have its foundation in the
book of Genesis itself.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Delitzsch</i> says, S. 256, &quot;Jehovah reveals Himself in the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;</span>, but just by means of a finite spirit
becoming visible, and therefore in a manner more tolerable to him who occupies a
lower place of communion with God.&quot; And similarly, <i>Hofmann</i> expresses himself,
S. 335: &quot;It is quite the same thing whether it be said, he saw God, or an angel,
as is testified by Hosea also; and nowhere have we less right to explain it as if
it were an appearance of God the Son, in contrast with the appearance of an angel.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">But since it is an essentially different matter, whether Jacob
wrestled with God Himself, or, in the first instance, with an ordinary angel merely,
we have, as regards this opinion, only the choice between accusing the prophet Hosea,
who brought in the angel, of an Euhemerismus, or of raising against sacred history
the charge that it cannot be relied on, because it omitted so important
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span> a circumstance. The name Israel, by which,
&quot;at the same time, the innermost nature of the covenant-people was fixed, and the
divine law of their history was established&quot; (<i>Delitzsch</i>), is, in that case,
a falsehood. Jacob has overcome omnipotence, and, in this one adversary, all others
who might oppose him,&mdash;as he is expressly assured in ver. 29: &quot;Thou hast wrestled
with God and <i>with men</i>, and hast prevailed.&quot; Can God invest a creature with
omnipotence? Jacob would certainly not have gone so cheerfully to meet Esau, if
in Him over whom he prevailed with weeping and supplication, he himself had recognised
only an angel, and not Jehovah the God of hosts, as Hosea, in ver. 6, calls the
very same, of whom in ver. 5 he had spoken as the angel. The consolatory import
of the event for the Church of all times is destroyed, if Jacob had to do with a
created angel only. With such an one, Jacob had not to reckon on account of his
sinfulness, and it is just the humiliating consciousness of this his sinfulness
which forms the point at issue in his wrestling. Moreover, with such a view, the
New Testament Antitype would be altogether lost. Jesus, the true Israel, does not
wrestle with an angel,&mdash;such an one only appears to strengthen Him in His struggle,
Luke xxii. 43&mdash;but with God, Heb. v. 7.&mdash;The occurrence would, according to this opinion,
furnish a strong argument for the worship of angels: &quot;He wept and made <i>supplication</i>
unto him,&quot; Hos. xii. 5 (compare Deut. iii. 23). The
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</span>, mentioned in
Col. iv. 12, in allusion to our passage, would, in that case, besides God, have
the angels for its object.</p>
<p class="normal">If an ordinary angel were here to be understood, we must likewise
believe that an angel is spoken of in Gen. xxxv. 9 seq. For, of the same angel with
whom Jacob wrestled, Hosea says that Jacob found him in Bethel: &quot;And he wrestled
with the Angel and prevailed, he wept and made supplication unto him; he found him
in Bethel, and there he spake with us.&quot; (<i>Tarnov</i>: &quot;<i>Nobiscum qui in lumbis
Jacobi hærebamus.</i>&quot;) Then, it must have been a common angel, too, who appeared
to Jacob in Gen. xxviii. 10 ff.; for chap. xxxv. 9, compared with ver. 7, does not
allow us to doubt of the identity of him who appeared on these two occasions. But
such an idea cannot be entertained for a moment; for in chap. xxviii. 13, Jehovah
is contrasted with the angels ascending and descending on the ladder.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span></p>
<p class="normal">In <a name="div2_125" href="#div2Ref_125">Gen. xlviii. 15, 16</a>,
we read of Jacob: &quot;<i>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did walk, and the God which fed me all my life long unto this
day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In this passage, God first appears, twice in the indefiniteness
of His nature, and then, specially, as the Angel concerned for Jacob and his posterity.</p>
<p class="normal">By the Angel, we cannot here understand a divine emanation and
messenger, because no permanent character belongs to such; while here the whole
sum of the preservations of Jacob, and of the blessings upon Ephraim and Manasseh,
is derived from the Angel. And just as little can we thereby understand a created
angel, according to the view of <i>Hofmann</i>, who, in S. 87, says: &quot;Jacob here
makes mention of God, not thrice, but twice only; first as the God of his fathers,
and then as the God of his own experience, but in such a way that in ver. 16 he
names, instead of God, the Angel who watched over him; and he does so for the purpose
of denoting the special providence of which he had been the object.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The analogy of the threefold blessing of Aaron in Num. vi. 24-26
would lead us to expect that the name of God should be three times mentioned. No
created angel could in this manner be placed by the side of God, or be introduced
as being independent of, and co-ordinate with, Him. Such an angel can only be meant
as is connected with God by oneness of nature, and whose activity is implied in
that of God. The singular <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;</span> is here of
very special significance. It indicates that the Angel is joined to God by an inseparable
oneness, and that his territory is just as wide as that of Elohim.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_125a" href="#ftn_125a">[1]</a></sup>
If by the angel we understand some created one, we cannot then avoid the startling
inference, that God is, in all His manifestations, bound <span class="pagenum">[Pg
126]</span> absolutely to the mediation of the lower angels. In the history upon
which Jacob looks back, the inferior angels do not appear at all as taking any part
in all the preservations of Jacob. Twice only are they mentioned in his whole history,&mdash;in
chap. xxviii. 12, and xxxii. 2. <i>Lastly</i>,&mdash;The angel cannot well be a collective
noun; for we nowhere meet with the <i>ideal</i> person of the angel, as comprehending
within himself a real plurality. (Compare remarks on Ps. xxxiv. 8.) We should therefore
be compelled to think of Jacob&#39;s protecting angel. But this, again, would be in
opposition to the fact, that Scripture nowhere says anything of the guardian angels
of any individual. Moreover, it is a plurality of angels that in xxviii. 12, xxxii.
2, serves for the protection of Jacob, and we nowhere find the slightest trace of
one inferior angel being attached to Jacob for his protection.</p>

Jehovah says to the children of Israel: &quot;<i>Behold, I send an angel before thee,

had contracted guilt by the worship of the golden calf. He who had hitherto led

on account of this sad intelligence, ver. 4.</p>
<p class="normal">The threatening of the Lord becomes unintelligible, and the grief
of the people incomprehensible, if by the Angel in chap. xxiii. an ordinary angel
be understood. But everything becomes clear and intelligible, if we admit that in
chap. xxiii. there is an allusion to the Angel of the Lord
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>, who is connected with Him by oneness
of nature, and who, because the name of God is in Him, is as zealous as Himself
in inflicting punishment as well as in bestowing salvation; whilst in chap. xxxii.
34, the allusion is to an inferior angel, who is added to the highest revealer of
God as His companion and messenger, and who appears in the Book of Daniel under
the name of Gabriel, while the Angel of the Lord appears under the name of Michael.</p>
<p class="normal">On account of the sincere repentance of the people, and the intercession
of Moses, the Lord revokes the threatening, and says in xxxiii. 14, &quot;My face shall
go.&quot; But Moses said unto Him, &quot;If Thy face go not, carry us not up hence.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal">That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, <i>face</i>,
signifies here the <i>person</i>, is granted by <i>Gesenius</i>: &quot;The face of some
one means often his personal presence,&mdash;himself in his own person.&quot; A similar use
of the word occurs in 2 Sam. xvii. 11: &quot;Thy face go to battle&quot; (<i>Michaelis</i>:
&quot;Thou thyself be present, not some commander only&quot;); and in Deut. iv. 37, where
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;</span> means <i>in</i>, or <i>with</i>, <i>
his personal presence</i>: &quot;He <span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span> brought them
out with His face, with His mighty power out of Egypt.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The state of things has in xxxiii. 14, 15, evidently become again
what it was in xxiii. 20, 21. The face of the Lord in the former passage, is the
Angel of the Lord in the latter. Hence, we cannot here admit the idea of some inferior
angel; we can think only of that Angel who is connected with the Lord by oneness
of nature.</p>
<p class="normal">The connection between the face of the Lord in xxxiii. 14, 15,
and the Angel in whom is the name of the Lord, in xxiii., becomes still more evident
by Is. lxiii. 8, 9: &quot;And He (Jehovah) became their Saviour. In all their affliction
(they were) not afflicted, and the Angel of His face saved them; in His love and
in His pity He redeemed them, and He bore and carried them all the days of old.&quot;
The Angel of the face, in this text, is an expression which, by its very darkness,
points back to some fundamental passage&mdash;a passage, too, in the Pentateuch&mdash;as facts
are alluded to, of which the authentic report is given in that book. The expression,
&quot;Angel of the face,&quot; arose from a combination of Exod. xxiii. 20&mdash;from which the
&quot;Angel&quot; is taken&mdash;and Exod. xxxiii. 14, whence he took the &quot;face.&quot; To explain &quot;Angel
of the face&quot; by &quot;the angel who sees His face,&quot; as several have done, would give
an inadequate meaning; for by the whole context, an expression is demanded which
would elevate the angel to the height of God. Now, as in Exod. xxxiii. 14, &quot;the
face of Jehovah&quot; is tantamount to &quot;Jehovah in His own person,&quot; the Angel of the
face can be none other than He in whom Jehovah appeal&#39;s personally, in contrast
with inferior created angels. The Angel of the face is the Angel in whom is the
name of the Lord.</p>

claims for himself divine honour, in ver. 15, precisely in the same manner as the
Angel of Jehovah in Exod. iii., by commanding <span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
Joshua to put off his shoes, because the place on which he stood was holy. In chap.
vi. 2 he is called Jehovah. For it is evident that we are not to think of another
divine revelation there given to Joshua in any other way&mdash;as some interpreters suppose;
because, in that case, the appearance of the Captain, who only now gives command
to Joshua, would have been without an object. In chap. v. the directions would be
wanting; in chap. vi. we should have no report of the appearance.</p>
<p class="normal">There can be no doubt that, by the host of the Lord, the heavenly
host is to be understood; and <i>Hofmann</i> (S. 291) has not done well in reviving
the opinion of some older expositors (<i>Calvin</i>, <i>Masius</i>) which has been
long ago refuted, viz., that the host of the Lord is &quot;Israel standing at the beginning
of his warfare,&quot; and in asserting that the prince of this host is some inferior
angel. The Israelites cannot be the host of the Lord, that explanation is excluded
by the comparison with the host of the Lord mentioned at the very threshold of revelation,
in Gen. ii. 1; that which is commonly (Gen. xxxii. 2; 1 Kings xxii. 19; Neh. ix.
6; Ps. ciii. 21, cxlviii. 2, compared with 2 Kings vi. 27) so called, infinitely
surpasses the earthly one in glory, and of it the Lord has the name
<span class="sc">Jehovah Zebaoth</span>. It is only in two isolated passages of
the Pentateuch that the appellation which properly belongs to the heavenly hosts
of God is transferred to the earthly ones; and that is done in order to point out
their correspondence, and thereby to elevate the mind. In the first of these passages,
Exod. vii. 4, the &quot;host of the Lord&quot; is not spoken of absolutely, but it is expressly
said what host is intended: &quot;And I bring forth My host. My people, the children
of Israel.&quot; The second passage, in Exod. xii. 41, is similarly qualified, and refers
to the first. According to this view of <i>Hofmann</i>, the words, &quot;now I have come,&quot;
are quite inexplicable.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_129a" href="#ftn_129a">[1]</a></sup>
The Captain of the host of the Lord expresses Himself in such a manner as if, by
His coming, everything were accomplished. But if he was only the commander of Israel&mdash;an
inferior <span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span> angel&mdash;his coming was no guarantee
for success, for his limited power might be checked by a higher one. But if the
Captain of the host of Jehovah be the Prince of angels, we cannot by any means refer
the divine honour which He demands and receives, to Him who sent Him, in contrast
with Him who is sent; the higher the dignity, the more necessary is the limitation.
If the honour be ascribed to Him, He must be a partaker of a divine nature.</p>
<p class="normal">Jesus not at all indistinctly designates Himself as the Captain
of the Lord&#39;s host spoken of in our passage, in Matt. xxvi. 53:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7978; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#953; &#7940;&#961;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;

would be sufficient to refute the view which conceives of the Angel of the Lord
as a mere emanation and messenger. It also overthrows the opinion that he is an
inferior angel, inasmuch as the Angel of the Lord here appears as raised above all
inferior angels.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus there existed, even in the time of Moses, the most important
foundation for the doctrine concerning Christ. He who knows the general relation
which the Pentateuch bears to the later development of doctrine, will, <i>a priori</i>,
think it impossible that it should have been otherwise; and, instead of neglecting
these small beginnings, appearing, as it were, in the shape of germs, he will cultivate
them with love and care.</p>
<p class="normal">It is only at a late period, in Malachi iii. 1, that the doctrine
of the Angel of the Lord is expressly brought into connection with that of Christ.
But a knowledge of the divine nature of the Messiah is found at a much earlier period;
and we can certainly not suppose that the doctrine of the Angel of the Lord, and
that of a truly divine Saviour, should have existed by the side of each other, and
yet that manifold forebodings regarding their close obvious connection should not
have been awakened in the mind.</p>

<h1><a name="div1_130" href="#div1Ref_130">THE PROMISE IN 2 SAMUEL, CHAP. VII.</a></h1>
<p class="normal">The Messianic prophecy, as we have seen, began at a time long
anterior to that of David. Even in Genesis, we perceived <span class="pagenum">[Pg
131]</span> it, increasing more and more in distinctness. There is at first only
the general promise that the seed of the woman should obtain the victory over the
kingdom of the evil one;&mdash;then, that the salvation should come through the descendants
of Shem;&mdash;then, from among them Abraham is marked out,&mdash;of his sons, Isaac,&mdash;from among
his sons, Jacob,&mdash;and from among the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is singled out as
the bearer of dominion, and marked out as the person from whom, at length, should
proceed the glorious King whose peaceful dominion is destined to extend over all
the nations of the earth.</p>
<p class="normal">Whilst, hitherto, the tribe only had been pointed out, in the
midst of which an imperishable dominion should be established, and out of which
the Saviour was at last to come,&mdash;under David another feature was added by the determination
of the <i>family</i>. This was done in the prophetic announcement which the Lord,
by the prophet Nathan, addressed in 2 Sam. vii. to David, when he had adopted the
resolution of building to the Lord a fixed temple, instead of the moveable tabernacle
which had hitherto been used.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>And it happened when the king sat in his house, and
the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about.</i> Ver. 2. <i>And
the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See, now, I dwell in a house of cedar, and
the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The question here is:&mdash;To what time is the occurrence
to be assigned? The answer is:&mdash;To the time not long after David had obtained the
dominion over all Israel. To this opinion we are led by the position which the report
occupies in the Books both of Chronicles and of Samuel. The supposition is so very
probable, that nothing short of very cogent reasons could induce us to abandon it.
A narrative, in which David&#39;s accession to the throne is followed by the conquest
of Jerusalem, and this by the building of his palace,&mdash;and this again by the bringing
up of the ark of the covenant,&mdash;and this, still further, by David&#39;s anxiety for a
fixed sanctuary, evidently agrees with the order in which these events followed
each other. We can the less entertain any doubt concerning it, because we are expressly
told, that the wars and victories of David reported in chap. viii. were subsequent
to what is reported in chap. vii.; compare viii. 1. That the conquest of Jerusalem
and the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span> building of his palace belong to the
period soon after his accession to the throne, is both evident, and generally acknowledged;
but that David&#39;s anxiety for a fixed sanctuary was awakened in him soon after the
completion of his palace, is expressly stated in 1 Chron. xvii. 1. Instead of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1489;</span> in ver. 1 of our passage, we find there
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1489;</span>, &quot;when,&quot; or &quot;as soon as&quot; he dwelt.
We cannot well think of any later period, as David&#39;s zeal for the building of the
house of the Lord was closely connected with the question regarding the duration
of his own family, which was so readily suggested by the fate of Saul, and which
must necessarily have engaged his attention at a very early period. If he obtained
the divine sanction for the building of the temple, that question also was thereby
answered. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;It appears from ver. 12, that Solomon was not yet born
at the time when David received the promise. The circumstance, too, that there are
so many allusions to it in the Psalms of David, proves that this promise had been
already given to him at the beginning of his reign.&mdash;One circumstance only has been
adduced against assigning to it so early a period, viz., that the event is here
placed within the time when the Lord had given David rest from all his enemies round
about. But there is not one word which affirms that this rest was a definitive one;
while, on the other hand, the contrary is alluded to by the circumstance that the
Books of Chronicles make no mention at all of David&#39;s rest from his enemies, and
is distinctly indicated by viii. 1. In 1 Chron. xiv. 17 it is said, after the account
of David&#39;s victory over the Philistines (on which event the Books of Samuel report
previous to chap. vii., viz. in v. 17-25): &quot;And the name of David went out into
all lands, and the Lord gave his fear upon all the heathen.&quot; This previous result
was so much the more important, as the Philistines had been, for a long time, the
most dangerous enemies of Israel, and David himself may have considered it as a
definitive one,&mdash;may have imagined this truce to be a peace,&mdash;may not have been aware
that he had yet to bear the burden of the most trying wars. Looking, then, to the
passage in Deut. xii. 10, 11&mdash;in which the choice of a place where the Lord will
cause His name to dwell, is connected with the giving of rest from all enemies round
about&mdash;he might think that the present circumstance formed a call upon him to erect
a sanctuary to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span> the Lord.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_133a" href="#ftn_133a">[1]</a></sup>
But the issue (compare viii. 1) soon made it manifest to him, that the supposition
on which he proceeded was an erroneous one. We have a tacit correction of David&#39;s
mistake in 1 Kings v. 17, 18: &quot;Thou knowest how that David my father could not build
an house unto the name of the Lord his God, for the wars with which they surrounded
him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. And now the Lord my God
hath given me rest on every side, and there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.&quot;
It was only under Solomon that the period provided for by Deut. xii. really arrived.
(Compare 1 Chron. xxii. 19.)</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in
thine heart, for the Lord is with thee.</i> Ver. 4. <i>And it came to pass that
night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying:</i> Ver. 5. <i>Go and
tell My servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build Me a house to dwell
in?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In ver. 5 the question is stated, the answer to which is the point
at issue. In ver. 6, the exposition begins with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span>,
which refers to the whole of it, and not merely to the clause which immediately
follows. Hitherto, the Lord has not had a fixed temple (ver. 6), nor has any such
been wished for or desired by Him (ver. 7). By the grace of God, David has been
raised to be ruler over the people (ver. 8), and the Lord has helped him gloriously
(ver. 9), and, through him, His people (ver. 10). This mercy the Lord had already
bestowed upon him, that, since the beginning of the period of the Judges, it was
through him, first of all, that the people had obtained rest from all their enemies
round about; but to this favour the Lord is now adding another, by announcing to
him that He would make him an house (ver. 11). When David dies, his seed shall occupy
the throne, and be established in the kingdom (ver. 12). It is he who shall build
an house for the Lord who will establish for ever the throne of his kingdom, vers.
13-16.</p>
<p class="normal">David&#39;s zeal for the house of the Lord is thus acknowledged (compare
Ps. cxxxii. 1), and so also is the correctness of his supposition, that the building
of the fixed temple is intimately <span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span> connected
with his being raised to be ruler over Israel. The first answer of Nathan remains
correct; it is only more distinctly and closely defined and modified. David is to
build the house,&mdash;not, however, in his own person, but in his seed, and after the
Lord has begun to fulfil His promise, that He would make him an house.</p>
<p class="normal">But why was it that David himself was not permitted to build the
house to the Lord? In this passage we obtain no answer. In Solomon&#39;s message to
Hiram (1 Kings v. 17) an external reason only is stated&mdash;viz., that, by his numerous
wars, David had been prevented from building a house to the Lord. There was a deeper
reason than this; but the heathen could not comprehend it. It is contained in the
words which, according to 1 Chron. xxviii. 3, David spoke to the people: &quot;And God
said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for My name, because thou hast been
a man of war, and hast shed blood;&quot; and in the words of the Lord which, according
to 1 Chron. xxii. 8, David repeated to Solomon: &quot;Thou hast shed blood abundantly,
and hast made great wars; thou shalt not build an house unto My name, because thou
hast shed much blood upon the earth in My sight,&quot;&mdash;a disclosure which David could
have obtained only at a later period, and as a supplement to the divine communication
which had been made to him through Nathan. For it is only after the revelation in
2 Sam. vii. that David had to carry on his most bloody wars. We must not, by any
means, entertain the idea that these words express anything <i>blameworthy</i> in
David, and that the permission to build the temple was refused to him on account
of his personal unworthiness. David stood in a closer relation to God than did Solomon.
His wars were wars of the Lord, 1 Sam. xxv. 28. It is in this light that David himself
regarded them; and that he was conscious of his being divinely commissioned for
them, is seen, <i>e.g.</i>, from Ps. xviii.: it was the Lord who taught his hands
to war (ver. 35) and who gave him vengeance, and subdued the people unto him, ver.
48. The passages 1 Chron. xxii. 8, xxvii. 3, do not, in themselves, contain one
reproachful word against David. On the contrary, the words, <i>in My sight</i>,
in the former of these passages, rather lead us to suppose that David is, in his
wars, to be considered only as a servant of the Lord (<i>Michaelis</i>: &quot;<i>In My
sight</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, who am, as it were, the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
highest judge, and the commander&quot;). The reason is rather of a symbolical character.
How necessary soever, under certain conditions, war may be for the kingdom of God,&mdash;as
indeed the Saviour also says that (in the first instance) He had not come to send
peace, but a sword,&mdash;it is after all only something accidental, and rendered needful
by human corruption. The real nature of the kingdom of God is peace. Even in the
Old Testament, the Lord of the Church appears as the Prince of Peace, Is. ix. 5.
According to Luke ix. 56, the Son of Man is not come to destroy men&#39;s lives, but
to save them. In order to impress upon the mind this view of the nature and aim
of the Church, the Temple&mdash;the symbol of the Church&mdash;must not be built by David the
man of war, but by Solomon, the peaceful, the man of rest, 1 Chron. xxii. 9.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>For I have not dwelt in any house from the day that
I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day, and have walked
in a tent and in a tabernacle.</i> Ver. 7. <i>In all that I have walked among the
children of Israel, have I spoken one word with any of the tribes of Israel whom
I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying. Why build ye Me not a house of cedar?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">According to several interpreters, these words are intended as
a consolation to David for the delay in building the temple, and convey this sense:
that God did not require the temple, that the building of it was of no consequence,&mdash;as
sufficiently appears from the circumstance of His not having hitherto urged it.
But such a view would ill agree with the great importance which David continues,
even afterwards, to ascribe to the building of the temple,&mdash;-with the grand efforts
of Solomon towards it,&mdash;and with the exulting words which are uttered by the latter,
in 1 Kings viii. 13, after the work has been accomplished: &quot;I have built Thee an
house to dwell in, a settled place for Thee to abide in for ever.&quot; A comparison
of 1 Kings viii. 16-20 furnishes us with a clue to the right interpretation. In
that passage, the period before David is contrasted with that during which David
lived. (Compare the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;</span>, <i>now</i>, in ver.
8.) Hitherto, everything in the government had borne a provisional character, and,
hence, the sanctuary also. But now that, after the unsettled state of things under
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span> the Judges and Saul, <i>the definitive government</i>
has been called into existence with David, to whom the Lord will make an house,
the <i>definitive sanctuary</i> also shall be built,&mdash;only, that it shall not be
founded by David, but by his seed.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_136a" href="#ftn_136a">[2]</a></sup>
The words, <i>I have walked</i>&mdash;literally, I have been walking, I have continued
walking&mdash;<i>in a tent and in a tabernacle</i>, indicate not only that the Lord dwelt
in a portable sanctuary, but also, that the place of this sanctuary was oftentimes
changed, from one station to another in the wilderness, then to Gilgal, Shiloh,
Nob and Gibeon. This changing of the place of the tabernacle is still more distinctly
pointed out, in the parallel passage in 1 Chron. xvii. 5: &quot;And I have been from
tent to tent, from tabernacle to tabernacle;&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, I went from one tent
into the other, <i>e.g.</i>, from the dwelling-place of Shiloh into that of Nob,&mdash;a
mode of expression which pays no attention to the circumstance whether or not the
tent was materially the same. Instead of, &quot;With any of the tribes of Israel,&quot; we
find in 1 Chron. xvii. 6, &quot;With any of the judges of Israel,&quot;&mdash;a parallel passage
which very well explains the main text. The tribes come into consideration through
their judges, who, in the Book of Judges, always appear as judges in Israel, and
procured a temporary <span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span> superiority to the tribe
from which they proceeded.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_137a" href="#ftn_137a">[3]</a></sup>
The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;</span>, which has been doubted, is rendered
certain by 1 Kings viii. 16. (Compare, moreover, Ps. lxxviii. 67, 68.)&mdash;The reason
why no such word came to any one of these tribes is, that the superiority of none
of them was permanent; the election of all of them was merely temporary. The continuance
of the tent-temple was intended to indicate that the state of things was, in general,
provisional only, and that a new order of things was at hand. The creation of a
settled sanctuary was to be coincident with the establishment of an abiding kingdom,
to which the grace of God was vouchsafed. It was an evil omen for Saul that the
erection of a fixed sanctuary was not even mooted under him. The close of Ps. lxxviii.
likewise points out the intimate connection of the kingdom and the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 8. &quot;<i>And now, thus shalt thou say unto David My servant:
Thus saith the Lord, of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote,</i><sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_137b" href="#ftn_137b">[4]</a></sup>
<i>from behind the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel.</i> Ver. 9.
<i>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies
from before thee, and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great
men that are upon the earth.</i> Ver. 10. <i>And I gave room unto My people Israel,
and planted them, and they dwell in their place, and they shall no more be frightened,
and the sons of wickedness shall afflict them no more as heretofore.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Seven divine benefits are here enumerated,&mdash;one in ver. 8, which
forms the foundation of all the others, and three in each of the two following verses,&mdash;in
ver. 9, what the Lord has given to David,&mdash;in ver. 10, what, through him, He has
given to Israel. These benefits are so many symptoms that a <i>definitive</i> order
of things has now taken the place of the <i>provisional</i> one, and that, hence,
the moveable sanctuary will now be soon followed by the settled one. In the first
member of ver. 10, there is an enumeration of the benefits which the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span> people have already received through David;
in the second and third members, an enumeration of the benefits to be constantly
bestowed upon them through him. A commentary upon it is formed by Ps. lxxxix. 22-24,
in which it is said of David: &quot;With whom My hand shall be continually. Mine arm
also shall strengthen him. The enemy shall not exact upon him, nor the son of wickedness
afflict him. And I crush his enemies before him, and will smite those who hate him.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 11. &quot;<i>And since the day that I commanded judges over My
people Israel, I have given thee rest from all thine enemies. And the Lord telleth
thee, that the Lord will make thee an house.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The first part of this verse comprehends all the benefits formerly
enumerated;&mdash;the second adds another, which, however, is closely connected with the
previous ones. The circumstance that the Lord first gave rest to David, and, in
him, to the people, was a sign of his election which could not but manifest itself
afterwards in the care for his house. The promise, &quot;The Lord will make thee an house,&quot;
was to David an answer to prayer, as is shown by Ps. xxi. 3, 5, lxi. 6, cxxxviii.
3. Even the thought of building the temple was a question put to the Lord, as to
whether He would, in harmony with His past conduct, give a duration to his house,
different from that of the house of Saul.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. &quot;<i>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep
with thy fathers, I shall cause thy seed to rise up after thee which shall proceed
out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;</span> does not signify
the beginning of existence, but the elevation to the royal dignity.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;</span>, <i>seed</i>, denotes the posterity, which,
however, may consist of one only, or be represented by a single individual. In the
parallel passage, 1 Chron. xvii. 11, the words run thus: &quot;Thy seed which shall be
of thy sons,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, who shall be one of thy sons (Luther). The truth of the
promise, &quot;I shall establish his kingdom,&quot; became manifest, <i>e.g.</i>, in the vain
machinations of Adonijah. That the fulfilment of this promise must be sought in
the history of Solomon, in whom the difference between the house of David and that
of Saul first became evident (instead of, &quot;I establish,&quot; in ver. 12, we find, in
the second member of ver. 13, &quot;I establish for ever&quot;), is seen from 1 Kings viii.
20, where Solomon says, &quot;And the Lord hath performed His word which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span> He spake; for I am risen up in the room of
David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised.&quot; (Compare
1 Kings ii. 12: &quot;And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom
was established greatly.&quot;) </p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 13. &quot;<i>He shall build an house for My name, and I establish
the throne of his kingdom for ever.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The general establishment which was spoken of in ver. 12 precedes
the building of the temple; the eternal establishment mentioned in ver. 13 follows
the building of the temple, or is coincident with it. It is evident, that the first
clause of the verse refers, in the first instance, to the building of the temple
which was undertaken by Solomon. (Compare 1 Kings v. 19, where Solomon says, &quot;Behold,
I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake
unto David my father, saying. Thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy stead,
he shall build the house unto My name.&quot;) We shall not, however, be at liberty to
confine ourselves to what Solomon, as an individual, did for the house of the Lord.
The building of the house here goes hand in hand with the eternity of the kingdom.
We expect, therefore, that the question is not about a building of limited duration.
If a building of only a limited duration were meant, such, surely, might have been
erected long ago, even in the period of the Judges. The contrary, however, is quite
distinctly brought out in 1 Kings viii. 13, where, at the dedication of the temple,
Solomon says, &quot;I have built Thee an house to dwell in, a fixed place for Thee to
abide in <i>for ever</i>.&quot; If, then, with the eternity of the kingdom of David&#39;s
house the eternity of the temple to be built by him be closely bound up, the destruction
of the latter can be only <i>temporary</i>, and the consequence of the apostasy
and punishment of the Davidic race,&mdash;of which vers. 14 and 15 treat. Or, if it be
definitive, it can concern the <i>form</i> only. If the building of the temple fall
into ruins, it is only the Davidic race from which its restoration can proceed;
the local relation of the royal palace to the temple prefigured their close union.
Hence, the building of the temple by Zerubbabel was likewise comprehended in the
words, &quot;He shall build an house for My name.&quot; It was impossible that the second
temple could be reared otherwise than under the direction of David&#39;s family. But
we must go still farther. The essence of the temple consists in its being a symbol,
an outward <span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span> representation of the kingdom of
God under Israel. The real import of our passage then is,&mdash;that henceforth the kingdom
of David and the kingdom of God should be closely and inseparably linked together.
As the third phase, therefore, in the fulfilment of our prophecy, John ii. 19 must
come under consideration: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#955;&#8059;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#945;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;,
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#949;&#961;&#8182; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8057;&#957;</span>]. (Regarding the sense of this passage,
and the symbolical meaning of the tabernacle and temple, compare &quot;<i>Dissertations
on the Genuineness of the Pent.</i>&quot; vol. ii. p. 514 ff.) &quot;House of God&quot; is, in
ver. 14 of the parallel text, used of the Church, and in parallelism with &quot;kingdom
of God,&quot;&mdash;a sense in which it occurs as early as in Num. xii. 7.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_140a" href="#ftn_140a">[5]</a></sup>
This <i>usus loquendi</i> is quite common in the New Testament; compare 1 Tim. iii.
15; 2 Cor. vi. 16; Heb. iii. 6. In the first two phases of the temple of Solomon,
the house consists in the first instance of ordinary stones,&mdash;although, even at that
time, the <i>spiritual</i> is concealed behind the <i>material</i>; but in its third
phase, the material is altogether thrown off, and the house is entirely spiritual&mdash;consisting
of living stones, 1 Pet. ii. 5.&mdash;That the expression, &quot;for ever,&quot; in the second clause
of the verse, is to be taken in its strict and full sense, is proved not only by
the threefold repetition, but also by a comparison with the numerous secondary passages,
in which the duration of the Davidic dominion appears as absolutely unlimited. In
Ps. lxxxix., for example, where the promise is repeated, &quot;for ever&quot; corresponds
with, &quot;as the days of heaven&quot; in ver. 30,&mdash;with &quot;as the sun&quot; in ver. 37,&mdash;and with
&quot;as the moon&quot; in ver. 38. The final fulfilment of this promise is pointed out by
the words of the angel to Mary, in Luke i. 32, 33: <span lang="el" class="Greek">

<p class="normal">Ver. 14. &quot;<i>And I will be a father to him, and he shall be a

<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span></p>
<p class="normal">Wheresoever God is, in the Old Testament, designated as <i>Father</i>,
there is a reference to the deepest intensity of His love,&mdash;a love which is similar
to that of a father towards his son. (Compare remarks on Ps. ii. 7.) Sonship to
God has this significancy here also, as is shown by what immediately follows, where,
in explanation of it, the promise of indestructible love is connected with it. But
this relationship, in its highest and closest form, cannot exist betwixt God and
a mere man. It is only when the Davidic family is viewed as centring in Christ,
that the words can acquire their full truth. To this, the quotation in Heb. i. 5
points: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#932;&#8055;&#957;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#949;&#7990;&#960;&#8051; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#969;&#957;, &#933;&#7985;&#8057;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965; &#949;&#7990;
&#963;&#8058;, &#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#963;&#8053;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#954;&#8049; &#963;&#949;; &#922;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#8049;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#903; &#7960;&#947;&#8060; &#7956;&#963;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#956;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#965;&#7985;&#8057;&#957;</span>; The depth of meaning which is contained in these words appears
plainly from their expansion in Ps. lxxxix. 26: &quot;And I place his hand on the sea,
and his right hand on the rivers. He shall call Me thus: Thou art my Father, my
God, and the rock of my salvation. And I will also make him My first-born, the highest
of the kings of the earth.&quot; The sonship accordingly implies the dominion over the
world, which in Ps. ii. 7-9 appears, indeed, as inseparably connected with it.&mdash;If
the race of David commit sin, it shall be chastened with the rods of men, and with
the stripes of the children of men. Ps. xvii. 4 distinctly and unambiguously designates
corrupt actions&mdash;walking in the ways of transgressors&mdash;as &quot;the works of men.&quot; (Compare
1 Sam. xxiv. 10; Hos. vi. 7; Job xxxi. 33, xxiii. 12.) Hence, the rods of men, and
the stripes of the children of men, are punishments to which all men are subject,
because they are sinners, and at which no man needs to be surprised. Grace is not
to free the Davidic family from this common lot of mankind, is not to afford to
them the privilege of sinning. The mitigation only follows in ver. 15, in which
the close resumes the beginning: &quot;I will be a father to him.&quot; But this mitigation
must not be misunderstood by being conceived of as referring to the individuals.
Such a conception of it would be opposed to the nature of the thing itself, would
be in opposition to 1 Chron. xxviii. 9, where David says to Solomon, &quot;If thou seek
Him, He will be found of thee; and if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off <i>
for ever</i>:&quot; and would be against history, which shows that the rebellious members
of the Davidic dynasty were visited with destroying <span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>
judgments. The contrast is rather thus to be understood: sin is to be visited upon
the individuals, while the grace abides continually upon the race,&mdash;so that the divine
promise is raised to an absolute one. The commentary on it is furnished by Ps. lxxxix.
31 seq.: &quot;If his children forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments ... then
I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
But My loving-kindness will I not withdraw from him, nor will I break My faithfulness.&quot;&mdash;The
words from &quot;if he commit sin&quot; to &quot;children of men&quot; are awanting in the parallel
passage. This omission is intended to make the continuance of the mercy appear the
more distinctly, and to show, as indeed is the case, that the main stress is to
be laid upon it. We cannot for a moment conceive that any unworthy motive prompted
this omission; for the Chronicles were written at a time when the chastening rod
of the Lord had already fallen heavily upon the Davidic race. There would have been
stronger reasons for adding the words than for omitting them, inasmuch as, under
these circumstances, they were full of consolation. It is just upon these words
that the penman of Ps. lxxiv. dwells at particular length.</p>

the other texts quoted may be considered as a commentary.</p>
<p class="normal">It is certainly not the result of mere accident, that the twelve
verses of Nathan&#39;s prophecy are divided into two sections of seven and of five verses
respectively, and that the former again is subdivided into sections of three and
four verses. Its closing <span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span> words, &quot;The Lord
will make thee an house,&quot; are farther expanded in vers. 12-16.</p>
<p class="normal">We subjoin to the exposition of Nathan&#39;s prophecy, that of David&#39;s
prayer of thanks, because, by means of the thanks, the promise itself is more clearly
brought out.</p>
<p class="normal">The Lord has done great things for His servant in his low estate,
and has promised things still more glorious, vers. 18-21. By doing such glorious
things to His servant, He has manifested Himself as a faithful God, in harmony with
His revelations in ancient times, vers. 22-24. The thanksgivings for the promise
are followed in vers. 25-29 by a prayer for its fulfilment, intermingled with expressions
of hope.</p>
<p class="normal">As the promise was expressed in twelve verses, so are the thanks.
These twelve verses are again divided into seven and five, and the seven into four
and three.</p>
<p class="normal">The name of Jehovah occurs twelve times. Ten times is the address
directed to Jehovah. Once He is addressed by the simple name of Jehovah, six times
by that of Adonai Jehovah, twice by that of Jehovah Elohim, and once by that of
Jehovah Zebaoth. The address, Adonai Jehovah, occurs at the beginning and the close.
The third division first takes up the name of God which is used in the second, and
returns, at the close, to that which is used in the first division. In the parallel
passage in Chronicles, Jehovah occurs seven times, and Elohim three times.&mdash;Ten times
the servant of the Lord is mentioned in David&#39;s prayer, and seven times, the house
of David. The servant of the Lord occurs three times in vers. 18-21, and seven times
in vers. 25-29; the house of David twice in 18-21, and five times in vers. 25-29.
In vers. 22-24, where the manifestation of the mercies to David are brought into
connection with the glorious revelations of God in ancient times, neither the servant
nor the house is mentioned.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 18. &quot;<i>And King David came and sat before the Lord, and
said: Who am I, Lord Jehovah, and what my house</i> (literally, <i>who</i> my house,&mdash;the
house being conceived of as an <i>ideal</i> person), <i>that Thou hast brought me
hitherto?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Moses also was sitting in long-continued prayer, Exod. xvii. 12.
David, as a true descendant of Jacob (Gen. xxxii. 10), acknowledges his unworthiness
of the great mercies bestowed upon him. The comparison of Ps. cxliv. 3 is still
more striking <span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span> than that of Ps. viii. 5; for,
in the former, the words, &quot;Lord, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him;
the son of mortal man, that Thou hast regard to him?&quot; were uttered in praise of
the adorable mercy which the Lord had shown to his house.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 19. &quot;<i>And this is yet too little in Thy sight, Lord Jehovah;
and Thou speakest also to the house of Thy servant of things far distant; and this
is the law of man, Lord Jehovah.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> has only the
signification of <i>law</i>. Gesenius, in assigning to it the signification of
<i>mos</i>, <i>consuetudo</i>, has no other warrant for it than our passage. The
law of any one is the law which has been given for him, or which concerns him; compare
Lev. vi. 2 (9): &quot;This is the law of the burnt-offering;&quot; Lev. xiii. 7: &quot;This is
the law for her that hath born;&quot; Lev. xiv. 2: &quot;This shall be the law of the leper,&quot;
etc. Hence the law of man can only be the law regulating the conduct of man. Man
is commanded in the law: &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;&quot; compare Mic.
vi. 8: &quot;He hath showed, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee
but to do justice, and to <i>love kindness</i>, and to walk humbly before thy God?&quot;
The fact that God should, in His conduct towards poor mortals, follow the rule which
He hath given to men for their conduct towards one another, and that He shows Himself
to be full of mercy and love, cannot but fill him who knows God and himself with
adoring wonder. The words in Ps. xviii. 36 are parallel: &quot;Thou givest me the shield
of Thy salvation, and Thy right hand holdeth me up, and Thy meekness (the parallel
passage in 2 Sam. has: &#39;Thy being low&#39;) maketh me great.&quot; In the parallel passage
in Chronicles the words are these: &quot;And Thou hast regarded me according to the law
of man (concerning <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; = &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;</span> compare remarks
on Song of Sol. i. 10), Thou height, Jehovah God.&quot; The essential agreement of the
sense of the parallel passage with that of the fundamental passage, may be applied
as a test to prove the correctness of our exposition. &quot;To regard some one&quot; is used
for &quot;to visit some one,&quot; &quot;to have intercourse with some one;&quot; compare 2 Sam. iii.
13, xiii. 5, xiv. 24, 28; 2 Kings viii. 29. The words, &quot;Thou height&quot; (God is represented
as personified height in Ps. xcii. 9: &quot;And Thou art a height for evermore, O Lord&quot;),
bring out still more prominently the contrast with human lowness, which was already
implied in the names of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span> God, Adonai Jehovah,
and Jehovah Elohim, and serves therefore to show still more distinctly the condescension
of God, whose revelation on this occasion was a prelude to
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8001; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#8048;&#961;&#958; &#7952;&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span>. <i>Luther</i> has introduced
into the main text a direct allusion to the incarnation of God in Christ. He translates,
&quot;This is the manner of a man who is God the Lord;&quot; and adds, in a marginal note,
the following remark: &quot;This means, Thou speakest to me of such an eternal kingdom,
in which no one can be king unless he be God and man at the same time, because he
is to be my son and yet a king for evermore&mdash;which belongs to God alone.&quot; But this
single circumstance is sufficient to overthrow this view:&mdash;that in the preceding,
as well as in the subsequent context, Adonai Jehovah is always used in the vocative
sense.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 20. &quot;<i>And what shall David say more unto Thee?</i> (In
the parallel passage: &#39;As regards the honour for Thy servant.&#39;) <i>And Thou knowest
Thy servant, Lord Jehovah.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It is not necessary that David should make many words, in order
to express his thanks, as his thankful heart lies open before God. In Ps. xl. 10,
David also appeals to the testimony of the Omniscient as regards his thankful heart:
&quot;I preach righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I will not refrain my lips,
O Lord, Thou knowest,&quot;&mdash;knowest how with my whole heart I am thankful for Thy great
mercy. It is, in general, David&#39;s practice to appeal to God, the Searcher of hearts;
compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Ps. xvii. 3.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 21. &quot;<i>For Thy word&#39;s sake, and according to Thine own heart,
hast Thou done all these great things to make Thy servant know them.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In 1 Chron. xvii. 19, the words run thus: &quot;Lord, on account of
Thy <i>servant</i>, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou done all these great
things, to make known all the glorious things.&quot; Hence, by the &quot;word,&quot; a promise
given to David can alone be intended,&mdash;a word formerly spoken to David, which contained
the germ of the present one. There is, no doubt, a special allusion to the word
in 1 Sam. xvi. 12: &quot;And the Lord said. Arise and anoint him, for this is he.&quot; (Compare
2 Sam. xii. 7; Ps. lxxxix. 21; Acts xiii. 22.) <i>According to Thine heart</i>:
&quot;The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and <span class="pagenum">[Pg
146]</span> plenteous in mercy,&quot; Ps. ciii. 8. <i>All these great things</i>,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the promise of the eternal dominion of his house. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span>&mdash;words in which
David takes special delight&mdash;never mean &quot;greatness,&quot; but always &quot;great things.&quot; (Compare
remarks on Ps. lxxi. 21, cxlv. 3.) The words, &quot;To make know,&quot; etc., indicate that
the <i>making</i> refers, in the meantime, only to the divine decree.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 22. &quot;<i>Wherefore Thou art great, Lord God: for there is
none like Thee, neither is there any God besides Thee, according to all that we
have heard with our ears.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Wherefore</i>&mdash;in the first instance, on account of the great
things which Thou hast done unto me. <i>According to all</i>, etc., <i>i.e.</i>,
as this is confirmed by all, etc. Of this David has been reminded anew by his personal
experience. Just as he does here, David, in Ps. xl. 6, rises from his personal experience
to the whole series of God&#39;s glorious manifestations in the history of His people.
As to the words, &quot;There is none like Thee, neither is there any God besides Thee,&quot;
compare the fundamental passages Exod. xv. 11; Deut. iii. 24, iv. 35.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 23. &quot;<i>And where is there a nation on earth like Thy people
Israel, for whose sake God went to redeem them for a people to Himself, and make
Him a name, and to do for you great things, and terrible things for Thy land, putting
away from before Thy people, whom Thou redeemedst to Thee out of Egypt, heathen
and their gods?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">We must here compare the fundamental passages, Deut.
iv. 7, 34, xxxiii. 29, in which that which Israel has received from his God is praised,
as being without precedent and parallel. In <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1501;</span>
and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1498;</span> the address is, with poetical liveliness,
directed to Israel. <i>For you great things</i>&mdash;instead of, To do for them great
things, as the Lord has done for you. The phrase <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1502;&#1498;</span> means, literally, only, &quot;away from before Thy people;&quot; &quot;putting&quot;
must be supplied from the preceding <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514;</span>,
and from a comparison of the fundamental passages, Exod. xxiii. 28, 29, xxxiv. 11;
Deut. xxxiii. 27, to which the concise expression refers. The text in Chronicles,
which expressly adds what we have here to supply, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513; &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;</span>, &quot;to drive out before,&quot; is, in this case also, merely a parallel
passage which, by the addition of a word, serves as a commentary.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 24. &quot;<i>And Thou hast confirmed to Thyself Thy people</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span> <i>Israel to be a people for ever, and Thou,
Lord, art become their God.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 25. &quot;<i>And now, Jehovah God, the word that Thou hast spoken
concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do
as Thou hast said.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Praise and thanks for the promise are followed by the prayer for
its fulfilment.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 26. &quot;<i>And let Thy name be magnified for ever, so that it
may be said, Jehovah Zebaoth</i> (is) <i>God over Israel. And the house of Thy servant
shall be firm before Thee.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Let Thy name be magnified</i>, instead of, Give cause for its
being glorified; compare Ps. xxxv. 27, xl. 17.&mdash;<i>Is God over Israel</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
proves Himself to be such, by protecting the house of the king, on whom the salvation
of Israel depends. In Chronicles it is thus expressed: &quot;Jehovah Zebaoth, the God
of Israel, is God for Israel,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>. He fulfils to Israel what He promised
(Jarchi). The prayer for the establishment of David&#39;s house is expressed in the
form of confidence, in the conviction based upon the word of God, that such is according
to the will of God.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 27. &quot;<i>For Thou, Jehovah Zebaoth, God of Israel, hast opened
the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house. Therefore Thy servant
found</i> (in) <i>his heart to pray this prayer unto Thee.</i>&quot; (Otherwise, his
heart would have failed him; he would have had neither the desire nor the courage.)
Ver. 28. &quot;<i>And now, Lord Jehovah, Thou art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou
hast promised unto Thy servant these good things.</i> Ver. 29. <i>And now let it
please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before
Thee; for Thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken, and, by Thy blessing, the house of Thy
servant shall be blessed for ever.</i>&quot;</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">To whom does this promise refer, which David received through
Nathan? Some Rabbins, and <i>Grotius</i>, would fain restrict it to Solomon and
his more immediate posterity. This opinion, however, is refuted by the single circumstance,
that they are compelled to assume merely a long duration of time, instead of the
eternity which is here promised to the house of David. And that such cannot be the
meaning of the words &quot;for ever,&quot; is abundantly confirmed by a comparison with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span> Ps. lxxxix. 30, &quot;And I place his seed for
ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.&quot; In these words of the Psalm there is
a reference to Deut. xi. 21, where the <i>people</i> of the Lord are promised a
duration &quot;as the days of heaven and of earth.&quot; An absolute perpetuity is everywhere
ascribed to the people of God. If, then, the house of David is placed on the same
level as they, its perpetuity must likewise be absolute. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;with such
a view, it is impossible to comprehend what David here says in his prayer, regarding
the greatness of the promise, and also what he says in Ps. cxxxviii. 2: &quot;For Thou
hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name.&quot; The giving of the promise is there
placed on a loftier elevation than all the former deeds of the Lord.</p>
<p class="normal">Others&mdash;as <i>Calovius</i>&mdash;would refer the promise to Christ alone.
But vers. 14, 15 are decisive against this view; for, according to them, God will
not, by a total rejection, punish the posterity of David, if they commit sin,&mdash;from
which the reference is evident to a posterity merely human, and hence sinful. According
to ver. 13, David&#39;s posterity is to build a temple to the Lord,&mdash;a declaration which,
with reference to David&#39;s plan of building a temple to the Lord, can, in the first
instance, be understood in no other way than as relating to the earthly temple to
be built by Solomon. To this consideration it may be added, that, in 1 Chron. xxii.
9 seqq., David himself refers this announcement primarily to Solomon, and that Solomon,
in 1 Kings v. 5 seqq., and in 2 Chron. vi. 7 seqq., refers it to himself.</p>
<p class="normal">Nor is there entire soundness in the view of those who, following
<i>Augustine</i> (<i>de Civitate Dei</i> xvii. 8, 9), assume the existence of a
double reference,&mdash;to Solomon and his earthly successors on the one hand, and to
Christ on the other. Thus <i>Brentius</i>: &quot;Solomon is not altogether excluded,
but Christ is chiefly intended.&quot; It is true that these interpreters are substantially
right in their view; but they err as to the manner in which they give expression
to it. The promise has not a reference to two subjects simultaneously.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_148a" href="#ftn_148a">[6]</a></sup>
It views David&#39;s house as an <i>ideal</i> unity.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span></p>
<p class="normal">The promise is given to the house of David, vers. 11, 16, 19,
25, 26, 27, 29; to his seed, ver. 12. It is to the house of David that the absolute
perpetuity of existence, the unchangeable possession of the grace of God&mdash;a relation
to God similar to that of a son to his father&mdash;and the inseparable connection of
their dominion with the kingdom of God in Israel, are guaranteed.</p>

	what, in 2 Sam. vii., had been spoken to David, in reference to the house of
	the Lord: &quot;Since the day that I brought up My people Israel out of Egypt, I
	chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house that My name
	might be in it; and I chose David to be over My people Israel.&quot; The comment
	on this passage is given by the parallel one, 2 Chron. vi. 5, 6: &quot;I did not
	choose any man to be a ruler over My people Israel. And I have chosen Jerusalem
	that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.&quot;
	Since David resided in Jerusalem, the election of David, announced in 2 Sam.
	vii., implies also the choice of Jerusalem as the place of the sanctuary. Hence,
	we must add to 1 Kings viii. 16, the supplement: &quot;And in connection with this
	choice, David (the Davidic dynasty) is to build Me an house at the place of
	his residence.&quot; The Vulgate translates very correctly: <i>Sed elegi.</i> Solomon
	then continues, <i>Ver.</i> 17: &quot;And it was in the heart of David my father
	(namely, before he received this divine revelation) to build an house for the

	but not such as if they were to be fulfilled only in the person of Solomon,
	and not also in his posterity, and, most of all, in the Messiah to be descended
	from David and Solomon.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><a name="div1_149" href="#div1Ref_149">There is no direct mention
of the person of the Messiah;</a> and yet the words, when considered in their full
import, point, indirectly, to Him. The absolute perpetuity of the race can be conceived
of, only when at last it centres in some superhuman person. But still more decisive
is the connection in which this promise stands to Gen. xlix. The dominion which
is there promised to Judah is here transferred to David. It is then to David&#39;s race
that the exalted individual must belong, in whom, according to Gen. xlix. 10, Judah&#39;s
dominion is to centre at some future period. That David really connected the promise
which he received with Gen. xlix. 10, is shown by 1 Chron. xxviii. 4 (compare p.
91), and also by the name, Solomon, which he gave to his son; compare ibid. That
Solomon also founded his hopes regarding the future upon a combination of Gen. xlix.
and 2 Sam. vii., is shown by Ps. lxxii., which was composed by him; compare pp.
91, 92.</p>
<p class="normal">But, as respects this combination, David was not left to himself.
He received further light from the source from which the promise had come to him.
Although his mission was not properly a prophetic one,&mdash;although, in the main, it
belonged to him to describe poetically what had come to him through prophetic inspiration,
yet prophetic inspiration and sacred lyric are frequently commingled in him. The
man who is &quot;the sweet psalmist of Israel&quot; claims a
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> in 2 Sam. xxiii. 1, and, in ver. 2, says
that the Spirit of God spake by him, and His word was upon his tongue. In Acts ii.
30, 31, Peter declares that, by the divine promise, David received, first the impulse,
and afterwards further illumination, by the prophetic spirit dwelling in him. The
latter declaration, moreover, rests on the testimony of the Lord Himself, in Matt.
xxii. 43, where He says that in Ps. cx., David had spoken
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, seized with the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p class="normal">It is true that, in a series of Psalms, David is not any more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span> explicit and definite than the fundamental
prophecy, but speaks only of the grace which the Lord had conferred upon the Davidic
race by the promise of a dominion which should outlast all earthly things. Thus
it is in Ps. xviii., where, in the presence of the congregation, he offers those
thanks which previously he had, as it were, privately expressed, for the glorious
promise made to him;&mdash;in Ps. xi., where, in the name of the people, he expresses
thankful joy for this same promise;&mdash;in Ps. lxi. and in the cycle of Psalms from
Ps. cxxxviii. to cxlv.&mdash;the prophetic legacy of David&mdash;in which, at the beginning,
in Ps. cxxxviii., he praises the Lord for His promise of eternal mercy given to
him, and then, with the torch of promise, lightens up the darkness of the sufferings
that are to fall upon this house,&mdash;Psalms with which Ps. lxxxix. and cxxxix., which
were composed at a later period, and by other writers, are closely connected.</p>
<p class="normal">But there are other Psalms (ii. and cx.) in which David, with
a distinctness which can be accounted for only by divine revelation, beholds the
Messiah in whose coming the promise in 2 Sam. vii. should find its final and complete
fulfilment. Whilst David, in these Psalms, represents the Messiah as his antitype,
as the mighty conqueror, who will not rest until He shall have subjected the whole
earth to His sway, Solomon, in Ps. lxxii., represents Him as the true Prince of
Peace, and His dominion, as a just and peaceful rule. The circumstances of the time
of Solomon form, in a similar way, the foundation for the description of the Messiah
in Ps. xlv., which was written by the sons of Korah.</p>
<p class="normal">A personal Messianic element is contained in some of those Davidic
Psalms also which refer to the <i>ideal</i> person of the <i>righteous one</i>,
whose image we at last find fully portrayed in the Book of Wisdom. In these the
sufferings of the righteous one in a world of sin are described, as well as the
glorious issue to which he attains by the help of the Lord. After his own experience,
David could not have doubted that, notwithstanding the glorious promise of the Lord,
severe sufferings were impending over his family, and over Him in whom that family
was, at some future time, to centre. But his own experience likewise promised a
glorious issue to these sufferings. The Psalms in which, besides the reference to
the righteous one, and to the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span> people, the
allusion to the afflictions of the Davidic race, and to the suffering Messiah, most
plainly appear, are the xxii., the cii., and the cix.</p>
<p class="normal">There cannot be any doubt that the Messianic promise made considerable
progress in the time of David. It is, in itself, a circumstance of great importance
that the eyes of the people were henceforth directed to a definite family; for,
thereby, their hopes acquired greater consistency. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;The former prophecies
were, all of them, much shorter, and more in the shape of hints; but, now, their
hopes could become detailed descriptions, because a <i>substratum</i> was given
to them in the present. The Messiah had been foretold to David as a successor to
his throne,&mdash;as a King. Hence it was, that, in the view of David himself and of the
other psalmists, the earthly head of the Congregation of the Lord formed the <i>
substratum</i> for the future Saviour. The naked thought now clothed itself with
flesh and blood. The hope gained thereby in clearness and distinctness, as well
as in practical significance.</p>
<p class="normal">The slight hint of a higher nature of the Messiah, given in Gen.
xlix. 8, forms the main ground for the advancing and more definite knowledge, which
we find in the days of David and Solomon. Grand and lofty expectations could, henceforth,
not fail to be connected with the promise in 2 Sam. vii. 14, &quot;I will be a father
to him, and he shall be a son to Me,&quot; and with the prophecy of the absolute perpetuity
of dominion, in the same passage. In Ps. ii. 12, the Messiah appears as the Son
of God <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>,&mdash;as He, in whom to trust
is to be saved, and whose anger brings destruction. In Ps. cx. 1, He appears as
the Lord of the Congregation and of David himself,&mdash;as sitting at the right hand
of omnipotence, and as invested with a full participation in the divine power over
heaven and earth. In Ps. lxxi. eternity of dominion is ascribed to Him. In Ps. xlv.
7, 8, He is called God, Elohim.</p>
<p class="normal">Among the offices of Christ, it is especially the <i>Regal</i>
office on which a clear light has been shed. The Messiah appears prominently as
He &quot;who has dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth,&quot;
Ps. lxxii. 8. In Ps. cx., however, the office of the Messiah as the eternal <i>High
Priest</i> is first revealed to the congregation. He appears as the person who atones
for whatever sins cleave to His people, as their Intercessor
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span> and Advocate with God, and as the Mediator
of the closest communion with God. We have here the outlines, for the filling up
of which Isaiah was, at a later period, called. The <i>Prophetic</i> office of the
Saviour does not distinctly appear in the Psalms. It was reserved for Isaiah to
bring out into a clearer light the allusion given, on this subject, by Moses, after
it had been taken up again, for the first time since Moses&#39; day, by the prophet
Joel.</p>
<p class="normal">It was quite natural that David, who himself was exercised and
proved by the cross, should be the first to introduce to the knowledge of the Church
a <i>suffering Messiah</i>. But the doctrine has with him still the character of
a germ; he still mixes up the references to the Messiah with the allusions to His
types. It was from these that David rose to Him; it was from their destiny that
David, by the Holy Spirit, inferred what would befall Him. Nowhere, however, has
David directly and exclusively to do with a suffering Messiah, as had, afterwards,
the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p class="normal">In all that respects the Psalms, we must content ourselves with
merely a passing glance, lest we encroach too much upon the territory which belongs
to the Commentary on the Psalms. But &quot;the last words of David,&quot; preserved to us
in the Books of Samuel, we shall make the subject of a more minute consideration,
inasmuch as they form a connecting link between the two classes of Psalms which
rest on the promise in 2 Sam. vii., viz., those referring to David&#39;s house and family,
and those relating to the personal Messiah. The &quot;ruler among men&quot; whom we meet in
these &quot;last words,&quot; is, in the first instance, an <i>ideal</i> person,&mdash;viz., the
Davidic race conceived of as a person; but the <i>ideal</i> points to the <i>real</i>
person, in whom all that had been foretold of the Davidic family should, at some
future period, find its full realization. It is with a view to this person, that
the personification has been employed.</p>
<hr class="W20">
<h1><a name="div1_152" href="#div1Ref_152">2 SAMUEL XXIII. 1-7.</a></h1>
<p class="normal">The last words of David are comprehended in seven verses; and
these, again, are subdivided into sections of five and two <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 153]</span> verses respectively. First, there is a description of the fulness
of blessings which the dominion of the just ruler shall carry along with it, and
then of the destruction which shall overtake hostile wickedness.</p>
<p class="normal">It is not by accident that these last words are not found in the
collection of Psalms. The reason is indicated by the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> There is a prophetic element in the lyric
poetry of David wheresoever it refers to the future destiny of his house; but this
prophetic element rises, here, at the close of his life, to pure prophetic inspiration
and utterance, which stand on an equal footing with the prophecy of Nathan in 2
Sam. vii., and claim an equal authority.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>And these are the last words of David. David, the
son of Jesse, prophesies, and the man prophesies who was raised up on high, the
anointed of the God of Jacob, and sweet in the Psalms of Israel.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It is substantially the same thing, whether we understand: &quot;the
last words of David&quot; or &quot;the latter words of David&quot;&mdash;later in reference to xxi. 1.
For even Ps. xviii., which precedes in chap. xxii., belongs, according to its inscription
and contents, to the last times of David; it is, as it were, &quot;a grand Hallelujah
with which he withdraws from the scene of life.&quot; But, at all events, there is a
closer connection with that Psalm; in it, too, David has in view the future destiny
of his race, and we have here, in the last words, the prophetic conclusion of the
lyrical effusion there. From this connection with chap. xxii., the closer limitation
of the &quot;words&quot; follows. We learn from it that <i>holy</i> words only can be meant.
The solemn introduction, and the parallelism with the blessings of Jacob and Moses,
fully agree with and confirm this our introductory remark regarding the chronological
position of these &quot;words.&quot;&mdash;There can be no doubt that, in this introduction, there
is a reference to Balaam&#39;s prophecy in Num. xxiv. 3,&mdash;and this goes far to prove
how much David was occupied with the views which men of God had formerly opened
up into future times:&mdash;&quot;And he took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor
prophesies, and the man who had his eyes shut, prophesies: He prophesies who hears
the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down and having his
eyes open.&quot; The remarks which we made on that passage find here also a strict application:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span> &quot;Balaam begins with a simple designation of
his person, and then, in the following members, adds designations of such qualities
of this person as here come into consideration, and serve for affording a foundation
to the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> with which he opens his discourse.&quot;
As <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> always has the signification, &quot;word
of God,&quot; &quot;revelation,&quot; it can here be ascribed to David, as it was in the fundamental
passage to Balaam, only in as far as the word has been received by, and communicated
to, him. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span>, &quot;upon,&quot; &quot;over,&quot; stands here
for &quot;on high,&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_154a" href="#ftn_154a">[1]</a></sup>&mdash;those
over whom David has been raised up being omitted in order to express the absolute
sovereignty bestowed upon David, more, however, in his posterity, than in his own
person. (Compare Ps. xviii. 44: &quot;Thou makest me the head of the heathen;&quot; and in
ver. 48: &quot;God who avengeth me, and subdueth people under me.&quot;) <i>He who was raised
up on high</i>&mdash;With the exception of the bodily ancestor and the lawgiver, of none
under the Old Testament could this be with so much truth affirmed, as of David,
the founder of the royal house, which, in all eternity, was to be the channel of
blessings for the Congregation of the Lord, and to which, at last, all power in
heaven and on earth was to be given. <i>The anointed of the God of Jacob</i>&mdash;Such
is David, not only as an individual, but also as the representative of his race;
compare Ps. xviii. 51. He is pre-eminently the anointed, the Christ of God.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;</span>
plur. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span> signifies, according to derivation
and usage, not <i>song</i> or <i>hymn</i> in general, but the hymn in the higher
strain, the skilful, solemn song of praise; compare my commentary on Song of Sol.
ii. 12. David&#39;s Psalms are called <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;</span> of
Israel, because he sang them as the organ of the congregation, and because they
were appointed to be used in public worship; compare Comment, on Psalms, vol. iii.
p. vi. <i>Sweet in Psalms of Israel</i> here finds its place only on the supposition
that David, in his Psalms, spoke in the Spirit, Matt. xxii. 41-46; compare Commentary
on Psalms, vol. iii. p. vii. viii. The most distinguished excellence in poetry which
is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span> merely human cannot form a foundation for
the assertion in ver. 2. But if, on the other hand, David be an often times tried
organ of the Spirit for the Church, it cannot surprise us that in ver. 2 he even
declares that, in the Spirit, he there foretells the future. Thus the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> in our verse also has a good foundation.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>The Spirit of the Lord spake to me, and His word is
upon my tongue.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</span> refers
to the communication which David promulgates in the sequel, and not to other revelations
which he had formerly received, appears from its relation to the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> in ver. 1. We should lose the new revelation
announced in ver. 1, if ver. 2, and, hence, ver. 3 also&mdash;for the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</span> there evidently resumes the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</span>&mdash;refer to divine revelations which David,
or, as <i>Thenius</i> supposes, even some other person, had formerly received.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;</span>
is not &quot;through me,&quot; for in that case the Participle would have been used instead
of the Preterite; nor &quot;in me,&quot; for that is contradicted by the parallel passages
in which <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</span> occurs with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>; but &quot;into me,&quot; which is stronger than &quot;to
me,&quot; and marks the deeply penetrating power of the revelation by the Spirit; compare
remarks on Hosea i. 2. Such being the case, the Preterite is quite in its proper
place; for the inward revelation, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>
precedes the communication&mdash;the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;</span>. (On
the whole verse, 1 Pet. i. 11, 2 Pet. i. 21, are to be compared.)</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to
me: a Ruler over men&mdash;just; a Ruler&mdash;fear of God.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The omission of the verb, &quot;will be or rise,&quot; is quite suited to
the concise and abrupt style of the divine word. The mention of God, the Rock of
Israel, shows that the revelation has a reference to what is done for the good of
the people of God,&mdash;of His Church. For her good, the glorious Ruler shall be raised.
(Compare the words, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8049;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#7992;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#8052;&#955; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span>,
in Luke i. 54, as also ver. 68, and ii. 32.) The appellation. Rock of Israel, indicates
God&#39;s immutability, trustworthiness, and inviolable faithfulness; compare my comment,
on Psalm xviii. 3, 32-47. The connection betwixt Ps. xviii. and the &quot;last words
of David&quot; here also clearly appears. The fundamental passage is Deut. xxxii. 4.&mdash;That
<i>men</i> must be conceived of as the subjects of dominion, is proved by Ps. xviii.
44, where David is made the head of nations, and people whom he has not known
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span> serve him,&mdash;and by ver. 45, where the sons
of the stranger do homage to him,&mdash;and by ver. 48: &quot;Who subdues people under me.&quot;&mdash;<i>A
Ruler</i>&mdash;<i>fear</i> of God, <i>i.e.</i>, a Ruler who shall, as it were, be fear
of God itself&mdash;personified fear of God. We must here compare the expression, &quot;This
man is the peace,&quot; Mic. v. 4, and, as to the substance of the expression. Is. xi.
2, &quot;And the Spirit of the Lord rests upon him ... the spirit of knowledge and of
the fear of the Lord.&quot; We might be disposed to refer this exclusively to the person
of the Messiah, especially when those Psalms are compared which refer to a personal
Messiah. But Ps. xviii.&mdash;which here receives, as it were, its prophetic seal&mdash;and
especially the relation of ver. 3 and 4 to ver. 5, where David speaks of his house,
prove that the Ruler here is, primarily, only an ideal person, viz., the seed of
David spoken of in Ps. xviii. 51. Things so glorious can, however, be ascribed to
it only with a reference to the august personage in whom that seed will centre at
the end of days,&mdash;the righteous Branch, whom the Lord will raise up unto David (Jer.
xxiii. 5), who executeth judgment and righteousness on earth, Jer. xxxiii. 15. David
knew too well what human nature is, and what is in man, to have expected any such
thing from the collective body, as such.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>And as the light of the morning when the sun riseth,
a mourning without clouds; by brightness, by rain,&mdash;grass out of the earth.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In the first hemistich we have to supply: will be His appearance
in its loveliness and saving importance. The morning elsewhere also, especially
in the Psalms (compare remarks on Ps. lix. 17; Song of Sol. iii. 1), is used as
the emblem of salvation. The condition of men before the appearance of the Ruler
among them, is, in its destitution, like dark night.&mdash;The <i>brightness</i> is that
of the Ruler, as the spiritual Sun, the Sun of Salvation. (Compare Mal. iii. 20
[iv. 2], where righteousness is represented as the sun rising to those who fear
God.) The <i>rain</i>&mdash;the warm, mild rain, not the winter&#39;s rain which, in the Song
of Sol. ii. 11, and elsewhere, occurs as an emblem of affliction and judgment&mdash;is
the emblem of blessing (compare Is. xliv. 3, where &quot;rain&quot; is explained by &quot;blessing&quot;).
The <i>grass</i>, which springs up out of the earth by means of sunshine and rain,
is emblematical of the fruits and effects of salvation. <span class="pagenum">[Pg
157]</span> (Compare Is. xlv. 8, where, in consequence of the rain of salvation
pouring down from the skies, the earth brings forth salvation and righteousness.)
The passage in Ps. lxxii. 6 is parallel, where Solomon says of his Antitype, &quot;He
shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers watering the earth.&quot; The
figure of the rain making fresh grass to spring up is there likewise employed to
designate the blessings of the Messianic time.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>For is not thus my house with God? For He has made
with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and kept; for all my salvation,
and all pleasure,&mdash;should He not make it to grow?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The special revelation which David received at the close
of his life (compare the remarks on <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</span> in
ver. 1) is here connected with the fundamental promise in 2 Sam. vii., which was
thereby anew confirmed to him. Those who, like <i>De Wette</i> and <i>Thenius</i>,
mistake the correct sense of vers. 3 and 4, are not a little perplexed by the &quot;<i>for</i>&quot;
at the beginning of this verse, and attempt in vain to account for it.&mdash;<i>Thus</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, as it had been told in what precedes.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492;</span>,
&quot;prepared,&quot; &quot;ordered,&quot; forms the contrast to what is only half finished, indefinite,
depending upon circumstances and conditions, admitting of provisions and exceptions.
The extent to which all interposing obstacles were excluded, or rather, had been
considered and calculated upon beforehand, appears especially from 2 Sam. vii. 14,
15, according to which, even the most fatal of all interpositions&mdash;the apostasy of
the bearers of the covenant&mdash;should not destroy the covenant,&mdash;should not annul the
gracious promise made to the race. <i>Kept</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, firm, inviolable, because
given by Him who keepeth covenant and mercy, Deut. vii. 9; Dan. ix. 4. In 1 Kings
viii. 25, Solomon prays, &quot;And now, Lord God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David
my father what Thou promisedst him when Thou saidst. There shall not be cut off
unto thee a man from My sight to sit on the throne of Israel.&quot; The second &quot;<i>for</i>&quot;
points out the cause of <i>kept</i>. <i>All pleasure</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, all that
is well-pleasing to me, all that my heart desires. The preceding
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1506;&#1497;</span> serves the purpose of qualifying it more
definitely. The object of David&#39;s desires is, accordingly, his salvation, the glory
of his house.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>And wickedness, like thorns, they will all be driven
away; for not will any one take them into his hands.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The subject treated of in this verse is: the Ruler among men
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span> in His relation to His enemies. To those He
is as formidable as His appearance is blessed to those who surrender themselves
to Him. In Ps. xviii. also, there is a celebration of the indomitable power which
the Lord grants to David, His anointed, and to his seed against all their enemies;
compare ver. 38: &quot;I pursue mine enemies and overtake them, and do not turn again
till they are consumed; ver. 39, I crush them and they cannot rise, they fall under
my feet.&quot; In the cycle of Psalms from cxxxviii. to cxlv., David likewise speaks
of the dangers which threaten his house from enemies, and the leading thought of
Ps. ii. is: the Messiah as the conqueror of His enemies. The eyes of David were
the more opened to this circumstance, the more he himself had had to contend against
adversaries.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;</span> always means unworthiness
in a moral point of view, &quot;wickedness,&quot; &quot;vileness.&quot; <i>Wickedness</i> is here used
in the concrete sense = the wicked ones, the sons of wickedness, Deut. xiii. 14.
The wicked ones, the enemies of the Church, are compared to the thorns, on account
of their pricking nature; and therefore their end is like that of thorns, they will
be thrown aside like them. In Ezek. xxiv. 28, after the judgment upon the neighbouring
people has been proclaimed, it is said, &quot;And there shall remain no more a pricking
brier everywhere round about the house of Israel, where their enemies are, nor a
grieving thorn;&quot; compare Num. xxxiii. 55; Song of Sol. ii. 2; Is. xxvii. 4; Nahum
i. 10.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1504;&#1491;</span>, the <i>Partic. Hoph.</i> of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;</span>, &quot;thrust out,&quot; &quot;put to flight&quot; (compare
Ps. xxxvi. 12), cannot be applied to the thorns, but only to the men. <i>Like thorns</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, so that they become like thorns, of which the land is cleared. <i>For
not will any one take them into his hands</i>&mdash;<i>Michaelis</i>: <i>Intractabiles
sunt.</i></p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 7. &quot;<i>And if any one toucheth them, he is filled with iron,
and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burnt with fire where they dwell.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The two members of vers. 6 and 7 stand in an inverted relation
to each other. In ver. 6, we have, first, the punishment described, and then their
hostile nature, by which the punishment was called forth. In ver. 7, we have, first,
the cause, and then the consequence. The thought in the first member is: every touch
of them bears a hostile character. <i>Iron</i>&mdash;instead of weapons fabricated of
iron; comp. 1 Sam. xvii. 7; Job xx. 24, xli. 19 compared with vers. 18, 20; Jer.
xv. 12. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span> <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1489;&#1514;</span>,
literally, &quot;in the dwelling&quot; (compare Ps. xxiii. 6, xxvii. 4; Deut. xxx. 20) instead
of &quot;where they dwell,&quot; shows that in their own borders they shall be visited and
overtaken by retribution. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1489;&#1514;</span> cannot have

<h1><a name="div1_159" href="#div1Ref_159">THE SONG OF SOLOMON.</a></h1>
<p class="normal">An important link in the chain of the Messianic hopes is formed
by the Song of Solomon. It is intimately associated with Ps. lxxii., which was written
by Solomon, and represents the Messiah as the Prince of Peace, imperfectly prefigured
by Solomon as His type. As in this Psalm, so also in the Song of Solomon, the coming
of the Messiah forms the subject throughout, and He is introduced there under the
name of Solomon, the Peaceful One. His coming shall be preceded by severe afflictions,
represented under the emblems of the scorching heat of the sun, of winter, of rain,
of dark nights, and of the desert. Connected with this coming is the reception of
the heathen nations into His kingdom, and this, through the medium of the old Covenant-people.
</p>
<p class="normal">Thus far the first part, down to chap. v. 1. The subjects contained
in the second part are, the sin of the daughter of Zion against the heavenly Solomon
and the judgment; then, repentance and reunion, which will be accomplished by the
co-operation of the daughters of Jerusalem, <i>i.e.</i>, of the very heathen nations
who had formerly received salvation through them; the complete re-establishment
of the old relation of love, in consequence of which the daughter of Zion again
occupies the centre of the kingdom of God; and the indissoluble nature of this covenant
of love now anew entered into, in contrast with the instability of the former.</p>
<p class="normal">The Song of Solomon does not, strictly speaking, possess a prophetical
character. It does not communicate any new revelations; like the Psalms, it only
represents, in a poetical form, things already known. It sufficiently appears from
our former statement, that, in the first part of this book, not one feature occurs
which did not form a part of those Messianic prophecies <span class="pagenum">[Pg
160]</span> which we can prove to have been known at the time of Solomon. In the
second part, however, it is somewhat different. No corresponding parallel can be
adduced from any former time to the view, that a great part of the people would
reject the salvation offered to them in Christ, and, thereby, draw down judgment
upon themselves. Yet, all that the book under consideration contains upon this point,
is only the application of a general truth, the knowledge of which the covenant-people
had received at the very beginning of their history. A consideration of human nature
in general, and more especially of Israel&#39;s character, as it had been deeply and
firmly impressed upon the people by the Mosaic law, joined to the ample experience
which history had afforded in this respect, sufficiently convinced those who were
more enlightened, that it could not be by any means expected&mdash;that, indeed, it was
even impossible&mdash;that, at the coming of the Messiah, the whole people would sincerely
and heartily receive Him, and do homage to Him. And there existed, on the other
hand, at the time of Solomon also, the foundation for the doctrine of the final
restoration of the people. For, even in the Pentateuch, the election of Israel by
God is represented as irrevocable and absolute, and which, therefore, must at last
triumph over all apostasy and covenant-breaking on the part of the people.</p>
<p class="normal">The Song of Solomon, then, is no <i>apocalypsis</i>, no revelation
of mysteries till then unknown. There is in it no such disclosure as is, <i>e.g.</i>,
that in 2 Sam. vii., on the descent of the Messiah from David; or, as is that in
Mic. v. 1 (2), on His being born at Bethlehem; or even as is that in Is. liii. on
His office as a High Priest, and His vicarious satisfaction. But, nevertheless,
we must not imagine the case to have been thus, that the contents of the Song of
Solomon could have originated merely from reflection on the part of Solomon. The
truths hitherto revealed had too much of the character of mere germs to allow us
to suppose that from them, and in such a way, we could account for the clearness
and certainty with which they have been blended into one whole. Another element,
moreover, must be joined to the historical ground&mdash;viz., an elevated condition of
the soul, a &quot;being in the Spirit,&quot;&mdash;a breathing of the divine Spirit upon the human.
History bears witness that such prophetic states, in the wider sense, were not strange
to Solomon. It twice <span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span> reports about the Lord&#39;s
having appeared to him, 1 Kings iii. 5, ix. 2. From such an elevated state of soul,
his dedicatory prayer, in 1 Kings viii., and Ps. lxxii., also originated.</p>
<p class="normal">We must content ourselves with these hints as regards Solomon&#39;s
Song. As it moves throughout on Messianic ground, the Author must consider his commentary
on this book (Berlin, 1853) as an appendix to the Christology.</p>

<h1><span class="sc"><a name="div1_162" href="#div1Ref_162">MESSIANIC PREDICTIONS
IN THE PROPHETS.</a></span></h1>
<hr class="W20">
<p class="normal">After the time of Solomon, the Messianic prediction was for a
considerable time discontinued. It was first resumed, and farther expanded, by the
Canonical prophecy which began under Uzziah. There cannot be any doubt that that
which <i>appears</i> as an interval was <i>really</i> such. There is no ground for
the supposition that any important connecting links have been lost. The Messianic
prediction in the oldest canonical prophets is immediately connected with that which
existed previously at the time of David and Solomon.</p>
<p class="normal">It is not a matter of chance that, whilst the blossom of prophetism
appeared as early as Samuel, the canonical prophetism took its rise at a much later
date. Nor is it the result of accident, that we do not possess any written prophecies,
either by Elijah, who, at the transfiguration of the Lord, appeared as the representative
of all the Old Testament prophets, or by Elisha. Nor is it merely accidental that,
at the time of Uzziah, there appears all at once, and simultaneously, a whole series
of prophets. All these things are connected with the circumstance, that it was only
at that time that great events for the Covenant-people were in preparation,&mdash;that,
only then, those catastrophes were impending which were to be brought about by the
Asiatic kingdoms, and which kept equal pace with the sin of Israel, the measure
of which was being more and more filled up. Canonical prophecy is closely linked
with these catastrophes. It is called to disclose to the Church the meaning of these
judgments, and, thereby, to secure to them their effects in all time coming. The
Messianic predictions uttered by the prophets are likewise closely connected with
the announcement of these judgments. Whilst false security was shaken by the threatenings,
despondency&mdash;which is as <span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span> hostile to true conversion&mdash;was
prevented by pointing to the future coming of the Saviour.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophets do not deliver the Messianic prediction in its whole
compass, any more than do the writers of the Messianic Psalms. On the contrary,
it is always only certain individual aspects which they exhibit. The writers of
the Messianic Psalms take up those features which presented points of contact with
their own lives and their own experiences, or at least the circumstances of their
times. This is quite in keeping with the more subjective origin of Psalm-poetry.
Thus David describes the suffering Messiah surrounded by powerful enemies, and who,
after severe struggles, at length obtains victory and dominion. To Solomon, He appears
as the Ruler of a great and peaceful kingdom, and he beholds the most distant nations
reverentially offering presents to Him and doing Him allegiance. But the Prophets,
in pointing out this or that feature, are not so much guided by their own experience,
disposition of mind, and peculiar circumstances, as by the wants of those whom they
are addressing, and by the effect which they are anxious to produce on them. When
they have to do with pusillanimity, desponding at the sight of the heathen world
as it seems to be all-powerful,&mdash;they then represent the Messiah as the invincible
conqueror of the heathen world, who shall subject the whole earth to the kingdom
of God. When they have to deal with pride, trusting in imaginary prerogatives of
the Covenant-people, and boldly challenging the judgments of God upon the heathen,&mdash;they
then represent the Messiah as Him who shall make a great separation among the Covenant-people
themselves, and who shall be a consolation to the godly, while He brings inexorable
judgments upon the wicked when they have to do with those who mourn in Zion, who
through the inflicted judgments of the Lord have been brought to a deep sorrow on
account of their sins,&mdash;they then represent the Messiah as Him who shall one day
take away the sins of the land, who is to bear their griefs and carry their sorrows.
Now, as canonical prophecy extends over several centuries, during which circumstances,
wants, and dispositions the most diverse, must have taken place, and as the Messianic
prophecy is in harmony with these, it displayed, more and more fully, its riches,
and did so in a manner far more effective and vivid than it could possibly have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span> done had it been proclaimed in the form of
a discussion or treatise. As the Messiah was thus represented from the most various
points of view, and in the way of direct perception, and divine confidence,&mdash;as He
was thus everywhere pointed out as the end of the development. He could not but
become more and more the soul of the nation&#39;s life.</p>
<p class="normal">In the Messianic announcements by the prophets, no such gradual
progress in clearness and distinctness can be traced, as in those of the Pentateuch.
The assertion that there existed with them at first, only a general hope of better
times, unconnected with any person, rests on the unfounded hypothesis that Joel
is the oldest among all the prophets,&mdash;and at the same time on the erroneous assumption
that he was ignorant of a personal Messiah,&mdash;and, <i>further</i>, on the incorrect
supposition that the prophets, who write only what presents itself immediately to
their view, have not in their creed all that they omit to say. It is, <i>moreover</i>,
opposed by the prospect of a personal Messiah held out in the Pentateuch, the Psalms,
and the Song of Solomon. How very slender is the ground for inferring that, because
many essential points are not touched upon by Hosea, Joel, and Amos, they, therefore,
did not know them, is shown by the fact that neither do several among the later
prophets&mdash;as Jeremiah and Ezekiel&mdash;touch upon them, although the previous more distinct
prophecies of Isaiah were certainly known and acknowledged by them. We must never
forget that it is from above that each of the prophets received his share of the
prophetic spirit, and that this depended partly upon the measure of his receptivity,
which might have been greater with the former than with the latter prophets,&mdash;and,
partly, upon the wants and capacities of those for whom the prophecy was destined.</p>
<p class="normal">A central position, as regards the Messianic predictions, is occupied
by Isaiah. Even his Messianic prophecies, however, when viewed detached and isolated,
bear the character of onesidedness. He nowhere gives us a complete image of the
Messiah. But, whilst the other prophets were permitted to give only single disclosures,
he gives us, in the whole body of his Messianic prophecies, the materials for a
full and entire image, although not the image itself. The Fathers of the Church
have, therefore, rightly designated him as the Evangelist among the prophets. But
the transition to him from the Psalms and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
the Song of Solomon could not be Immediate. Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, and
Micah form, as it were, the connecting links. Proceeding from the Messianic promise,
in the shape which it had received at the time of David and Solomon, they give it
a standing in the prophetic message, and infuse into it new life by means of the
connection into which it is brought by them, and supplement it by adding single
new features.</p>
<p class="normal">It is our intention to give an exposition of the Messianic passages
in the prophets, according to their chronological order. In placing Hosea at the
head, we follow the example of those who collected the Canon, and who, regarding
not so much the succession of years as that of the governments, may have assigned
the first place to Hosea, because he is the most important among the prophets at
the time of Jeroboam in Israel, and of Uzziah in Judah, or because he really appeared
first, and the prophecy in chap. i.-iii. is the beginning of written prophecies.
The latter supposition most naturally suggests itself; the analogies are in its
favour, and no decisive argument has been brought forward against it.</p>
<hr class="W20">
<h2><a name="div2_165" href="#div2Ref_165">THE PROPHET HOSEA.</a></h2>
<h3><a name="div3_165" href="#div3Ref_165">GENERAL PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">That the kingdom of Israel was the object of the prophet&#39;s ministry
is so evident, that upon this point all are, and cannot but be, agreed. But there
is a difference of opinion as to whether the prophet was a fellow-countryman of
those to whom he preached, or was called by God out of the kingdom of Judah. The
latter has been asserted with great confidence by <i>Maurer</i>, among others, in
his <i>Observ. in Hos.</i>, in the <i>Commentat. Theol.</i> ii. i. p. 293. But the
arguments by which he supports this view will not stand the test. He appeals (1)
to the inscription. The circumstance that, in this, there is mention made of the
kings of Judah under whom Hosea exercised his ministry,&mdash;that they are mentioned
<i>at all</i>,&mdash;and that they are mentioned <i>first</i> and <i>completely</i>, while
only one of the kings of Israel is named, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
proves, according to him&mdash;especially on a comparison with the inscription of Amos&mdash;that
the prophet acknowledged the kings of Judah as his superiors. But this mode of argumentation
entirely overlooks the position which the pious in Israel generally, and the prophets
especially, occupied in reference to Judah. They considered the whole separation&mdash;the
civil as well as the religious&mdash;as an apostasy from God. And how could they do otherwise,
since the eternal dominion over the people of God had been granted, by God, to the
house of David? The closeness of the connection between the religious and the civil
sufficiently appears from the fact, that Jeroboam and all his successors despaired
of being able to maintain their power, unless they made the breach, in religious
matters also, as wide as possible. The chief of the prophets in the kingdom of the
ten tribes&mdash;Elijah&mdash;by taking twelve stones according to the number of the tribes
of Israel (1 Kings xviii. 31), plainly enough declared, that he considered the separation
as one not consistent with the idea of the Jewish kingdom, and that therefore, in
reality, it must at some future period be done away with; that he considered the
government in Israel as existing <i>de facto</i>, but not <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p class="normal">By none do we find this view so distinctly brought out as by Hosea.
&quot;They have set up kings, and not by Me&quot;&mdash;says the Lord by him, chap. viii. 4&mdash;&quot;they
have made princes, and I knew it not.&quot; In his view, then, the whole basis of the
government in Israel is ungodliness. Because they have chosen kings and princes
without God, and against the will of God, they shall be taken from them by God,
chap. iii. 4. Salvation cannot come to the people until Israel and, Judah set over
themselves one head, ii. 2 (i. 11), until the children of Israel seek Jehovah their
Lord, and David their king, iii. 5. These two things are, in his view, intimately
connected; no true return to the invisible head of the Theocracy is possible without,
at the same time, a return to the visible one&mdash;the house of David. What, at some
future time, the mass of the people, when converted, were to do, the converted individual
must do even now. He even now recognised the kings of the tribe of Judah as truly
his sovereigns, although he yielded civil obedience to the rulers of Israel, until
God should again abolish the government which He gave to the people in wrath, and
set <span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span> up in opposition to the government of
the house of David in His anger, on account of their apostasy. From all this, it
clearly appears that, in order to account for the peculiarity of the inscription,
we need not have recourse to the conjecture, that Hosea was a native of Judah. One
might, with as much reason, maintain that all the prophets in the kingdom of Israel,
who rejected the worship of the calves&mdash;and hence all the prophets without exception&mdash;were
natives of the kingdom of Judah. For the worship of the calves is quite on a par
with the apostasy from the anointed of God. Hosea mentions, first and completely,
the kings of the legitimate family. He then further adds the name of one of the
rulers of the kingdom of Israel, under whom his ministry began, because it was of
importance to fix precisely the time of its commencement. Uzziah, the first in the
series of the kings of Judah mentioned by him, survived Jeroboam nearly twenty-six
years; compare <i>Maurer</i>, l. c. p. 284. Now, had the latter not been mentioned
along with him, the thought might easily have suggested itself, that it was only
during the latter period of Uzziah&#39;s reign that the prophet entered upon his office;
in which case all that he said about the overthrow of Jeroboam&#39;s family would have
appeared to be a <i>vaticinium post eventum</i>, inasmuch as it took place very
soon after Jeroboam&#39;s death. The same applies to what was said by him regarding
the total decay of the kingdom which was so flourishing under Jeroboam; for, from
the moment of Jeroboam&#39;s death, it hastened with rapid strides towards its destruction.
If, therefore, it was to be seen that future things lie open before God and His
servants &quot;before they spring forth&quot; (Is. xlii. 9), it was necessary that the commencement
of the prophet&#39;s ministry should be the more accurately determined; and this is
effected by the statement, that it happened within the period of the fourteen years
during which Uzziah and Jeroboam reigned contemporaneously. That this is the main
reason for mentioning Jeroboam&#39;s name, is seen from the relation of ver. 2 to ver.
1. The remark there made,&mdash;that Hosea received the subsequent revelation at the very
beginning of his prophetic ministry, corresponds with the mention of Jeroboam&#39;s
name in ver. 1. But this is not all; nor can we say that, had it not been for this
reason, Hosea would not have mentioned any king of Israel at all, in order that,
from the outset, he might exhibit <span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span> his disposition.
There was a considerable difference between Jeroboam and the subsequent kings.
<i>Cocceius</i> remarked very strikingly: &quot;The other kings of Israel are not considered
as kings, but as robbers.&quot; Jeroboam possessed a <i>quasi</i> legitimacy. The house
of Jehu, to which he belonged, had opposed the extreme of religious apostasy. It
was, to a certain degree, acknowledged, even by the prophets. Jeroboam had obtained
the throne, not by usurpation, but by birth. He was the last king by whom the Lord
sent deliverance to the people of the ten tribes; compare 2 Kings xiv. 27: &quot;And
the Lord would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; and He saved them
by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.&quot; (2.) The <i>internal</i> reason adduced
by <i>Maurer</i> (S. 294) is equally insignificant. &quot;The <i>morum magistri</i>,&quot;
he says, &quot;are wont more slightly to reprove, in the case of strangers, that which
they severely condemn in their own people; but Hosea rebukes with as much severity
the inhabitants of Judah, when he comes to speak of them, as he does the Israelites.&quot;
But no certain inferences can be drawn from such commonplaces; for, in this way
we might as reasonably infer, that Isaiah and the writer of the Books of Kings were
natives of the kingdom of the ten tribes, because they censure the sins of the Israelites
as severely as they do those of the inhabitants of Judah. To this commonplace we
might as easily oppose another equally true, viz., the &quot;<i>morum magistri</i>, from
a partiality for their own people, are wont to judge more leniently of their faults
than of those of strangers.&quot; Such maxims require to be applied with the utmost caution,
even in the territory to which they belong, because one consideration may be so
easily outweighed by another. Here, however, its application is altogether out of
the question. The prophets, as the instruments of the Spirit, spoke pure and plain
truth without any regard to persons. Whether Hosea was a native of Judah or of Israel,
he would express himself in the same way concerning the inhabitants of Judah. He
would severely rebuke their sins, and at the same time readily acknowledge, as he
does, their advantages,&mdash;for &quot;Salvation cometh of the Jews.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">If, then, these be the arguments in favour of the Judean origin
of Hosea, it readily appears that the probabilities of such an origin, compared
with that of his Israelitish descent, are not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
even in the proportion of one to a hundred. The prophets were almost more numerous
in the kingdom of Israel than in that of Judah; and yet the entire history knows
of only two instances of prophets being sent from the kingdom of Judah to that of
Israel, viz., the prophet spoken of in 1 Kings xiii. and Amos. And the former of
these even scarcely belongs to this class, inasmuch as he received only a single
mission into the kingdom of Israel, and <i>that</i>, at a time when the prophetic
institution was not as yet organized there. In the case of Amos likewise, it is
manifest not only that he was only an exception to the rule,&mdash;as appears from the
transactions with the priest Amaziah, reported in Amos vii. (compare especially
ver. 12),&mdash;but still more plainly, from the mention in the inscription of his having
been a native of Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">With regard to the <i>time</i> of the prophet, the inscription
places his ministry in the reigns of the kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.
A long period is, no doubt, thus assigned to it,&mdash;a period embracing at least twenty-six
years of Uzziah&#39;s reign, and, in addition, the sixteen years of that of Jotham,
the sixteen years during which Ahaz reigned, and at least one or two years of the
reign of Hezekiah, making, at the lowest calculation, a period of sixty years in
all. </p>
<p class="normal">This exceedingly long duration of the prophet&#39;s ministry might
easily excite suspicion regarding the genuineness and correctness of the inscription;
but such suspicion is at once set at rest by the fact, that the statements contained
in the book itself lead us to assume a period equally extended. The <i>beginning</i>
of the prophet&#39;s ministry cannot be assigned to any <i>later</i> period; for, in
chap. i. 4, the fall of Jeroboam&#39;s house, which took place soon after his death,
is announced as a future event. <i>Moreover</i>, the condition of the kingdom appears
still, throughout the whole first discourse, as a very flourishing one. Nor can
the end of his ministry be assigned to any earlier period. For in chap. x. 14, an
expedition of Shalman or Shalmaneser against the kingdom of Israel (<i>Vitringa</i>,
<i>Proleg. in Is.</i> p. 6) is described as being already past, and a second invasion
is threatened. But the first expedition of Shalmaneser, reported in 2 Kings xvii.
1 seqq., is almost contemporaneous with the beginning of Hezekiah&#39;s reign. For it
was directed against Hoshea, king of Israel, who began his reign in the twelfth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span> year of that of Ahaz, which lasted sixteen
years. The exact harmony of the passage in Hosea with that in 2 Kings xvii. is very
evident. In 2 Kings xvii. 3, it is said: &quot;Against him came up Shalmaneser, king
of Assyria, and Hoshea became his servant and gave him tribute.&quot; This was the first
expedition of Shalmaneser. Then followed the second expedition, which was caused
by the rebellion of Hoshea,&mdash;in consequence of which Samaria was taken and the people
carried away. In Hos. x. 14, 15, it is said: &quot;And tumult ariseth against thy people,
and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day
of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces upon (her) children. So shall he do unto
you, Bethel, because of your great wickedness in the dawn of the morning, destroyed,
destroyed shall be the king of Israel.&quot; Hosea here declares that the beginning of
the destruction by Shalmaneser is the prophecy of the end of the kingdom of Israel.
The &quot;morning dawn&quot; is the time of apparently reappearing prosperity, when, according
to <i>Cocceius</i>, a time of peace begins to shine. In Amos iv. 13, v. 8, the prosperity
again dawning upon the kingdom of Israel is likewise expressed by &quot;morning&quot; and
&quot;morning dawn.&quot; The identity of Beth-arbel and Arbelah in Galilee can the less be
doubted, because recent researches have rendered it certain that this place, now
called <i>Irbid</i>, was an important fortress. (Compare <i>Münchener gelehrte Anzeigen</i>
1836, S. 870 ff.; <i>Robinson</i>, iii. 2, p. 534; <i>v. Raumer</i>, S. 108.) The
use of Beth-arbel, instead of the more common Arbelah, as well as that of Shalman
instead of Shalmaneser, belongs to the higher style. At the first expedition, the
decisive battle had, no doubt, taken place at Arbelah. They who disconnect this
passage from 2 Kings xvii. do not know what to make of it. <i>Simson</i> complains
of the darkness resting on the passage under consideration.&mdash;But Hos. xii. 2 (1)
likewise leads us to the very last times of the kingdom of Israel,&mdash;those times when
Hoshea endeavoured to free himself from the Assyrian servitude by the help of Egypt.
&quot;Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east-wind; he daily increaseth
lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried
into Egypt.&quot; Their sending oil to Egypt, notwithstanding the covenant made with
Assyria, is the lie, which goes hand in hand with desolation, while they imagine
thereby to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span> work deliverance. This explanation
has been already given by <i>J. H. Manger</i>, of whose <i>Commentarius in Hoseam</i>,
<i>Campen</i>, 1782&mdash;a commentary in many respects excellent&mdash;most of the recent commentators,
and, lastly, <i>Simson</i>, have, to their great disadvantage, not availed themselves.
<i>Manger</i> says: &quot;These words refer to the ambassadors who were sent with splendid
presents by king Hoshea to the king of Egypt, in order to win him over to himself,
and induce him to assist him against the Assyrians, to whom he had become subject
by a solemn treaty.&quot;&mdash;To the last times of the kingdom of Israel we are likewise
led by what occurs in other passages concerning the relation of Israel to Egypt
and Asshur. The matter has been falsely represented by very many as if two parties
among the people were spoken of,&mdash;an Assyrian and an Egyptian party. Nor is it so,
that the whole people turn at one time to Egypt in order to free themselves from
the Assyrians, and at another time to Assyria to assist them against Egypt. The
position is rather thus: The people, heavily oppressed by Asshur, at one time seek
help from Egypt against Asshur, and, at another, attempt to conciliate the latter.
Precisely thus is the situation described in vii. 11: &quot;They call to Egypt, they
go to Asshur.&quot; That by which Israel was threatened, was, according to viii. 10,
&quot;the burden of the king of princes, the king of Asshur,&quot; ver. 9. This they seek
to turn off, partly by artifices, and partly by calling to their help the king of
Egypt. Asshur alone is the king &quot;warrior&quot; (<i>Jareb</i>), v. 13, x. 6; he only has
received the divine mission to execute judgment; compare xi. 5: &quot;He, <i>i.e.</i>,
Israel, shall not return to the land of Egypt, and Asshur, he is his king.&quot; As an
ally not to be trusted, Egypt is described in vii. 16, where, after the announcement
of their destruction on account of their rebellion against the Lord, it is said:
&quot;This shall be their derision on account of the land of Egypt,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, thus
they shall be put to shame in the hope which they place on Egypt. Is. xxx. 1-5 is
quite analogous. In that passage the prophet announces that Judah&#39;s attempt to protect
themselves against Asshur by means of Egypt would be vain; compare, especially,
ver. 3: &quot;And the fortress of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the trust in the shadow
of Egypt, your confusion;&quot; and ver. 5: &quot;Not for help nor for profit, but for shame
and for reproach.&quot; Such historical circumstances, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
however, had not yet occurred under Menahem. At that time, Israel was not yet placed
in the midst betwixt Asshur and Egypt. It is expressly mentioned in 2 Kings xv.
20, that the invasion of Pul was only transitory, and that not conquest, but spoil,
was its aim. The real commencement of the Assyrian oppression is formed by the invasion
of Tiglathpileser at the time of Ahaz. Isaiah, in chap. vii., points out the pernicious
consequences of Ahaz&#39;s calling the Assyrians to his assistance against Syria and
Israel. The very fact of this war carried on against Judah by Syria and Ephraim
shows, that up to that time, Asshur had not laid his hand upon these regions. It
was only with the invasion under Ahaz that there was any display of Asshur&#39;s tendency
to make permanent conquests on the other side of Euphrates, which could not fail
to bring about the conflict with the Egyptian power.&mdash;&quot;King Jareb,&quot;&mdash;such had already
become the historical character of the king of Asshur, at the time when Hosea wrote;
but prior to the times of Ahaz and Hezekiah, he did not stand out as such.</p>
<p class="normal">There is no decisive weight to be attached to what <i>Simson</i>
advances in order to prove that we must fix an earlier date. He argues thus: &quot;Gilead,
which, according to 2 Kings xv. 29, was taken and depopulated by Tiglathpileser,
whom Ahaz had called to his assistance, appears in vi. 8, xii. 12 (11) to be still
in the possession of Israel. Hence, the ministry of the prophet cannot have extended
beyond the invasion of Judah by the Syrians and Ephraim.&quot; But since the book gives
the sum and substance of Hosea&#39;s prophecies during a prolonged period, there must
necessarily occur in it references to events which already belonged to the past,
at the time when the prophet wrote. In chap. i. 4, even the overthrow of the house
of Jeroboam appears as being still future.</p>
<p class="normal">But even although we could not establish, from other sources,
the statement contained in the inscription, the inscription itself would nevertheless
be a guarantee for it; and the more so, because there are other analogies in favour
of so long a duration of the prophetic office, which was sometimes entered upon
even in early youth. The inscription has the same authority in its favour as every
other part of the book; and it is hardly possible to understand the levity with
which it has, in recent times, been pretty generally designated as spurious, or,
at least, suspicious. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span> It is altogether impossible
to sever it from the other parts of the book. There must certainly have been some
object in view when, in ver. 2, it is expressly remarked, that what follows took
place at the <i>beginning</i> of Hosea&#39;s ministry. But such an object it will be
possible to point out, only in the event of its being more accurately determined
at what time this beginning took place&mdash;viz., still under the reign of Jeroboam,
when the state of things as it appeared to the eye did not yet offer any occasion
for such views of the future as are opened up in the first three chapters. Ver.
1 cannot, therefore, be regarded as an addition subsequently made, unless the words
in ver. 2, from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;</span> to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1506;</span> be so likewise. But these again are
most closely connected with what follows by the <i>Future</i> with <i>Vav convers.</i>,
which never can begin a narrative. There remains, therefore, only this alternative:&mdash;either
to regard the whole as having been written at a later period, or to claim for Hosea
the inscription also. We cannot agree with the view of <i>Simson</i>, that the remark
by which the beginning of the book is assigned to the beginning of the prophet&#39;s
ministry, originated from a chronological interest only; and we can the less do
so, because the prophet does not pay any attention to chronology in any other place,
but is anxious to give only the sum and substance of what he had prophesied during
a series of years. The only exception which he makes in this respect must have originated
from strong reasons; and such do not exist, if the inscription in ver. 1, or the
mention of the kings in it, be spurious. The mention of the beginning in ver. 2
would, in that case, be so much the more groundless, as we could know nothing at
all regarding the length of his ministry.</p>
<p class="normal">Much more fruitful, certainly, than all such vain doubts, are
the reflections of Calvin on the long duration of the prophet&#39;s ministry: &quot;How grievous
is it to us when God requires our services for twenty or thirty years; and, especially,
when we have to contend with ungodly people, who would not willingly take upon them
the yoke, yea, who even obstinately resist us! we then wish to be freed at once,
and to become pensioned soldiers. But, seeing this prophet&#39;s long protracted ministry,
let us take from it an example of patience, that we may not despair although the
Lord should not at once free us from our burden.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Many interpreters have zealously attempted to determine the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span> particular portions of this lengthened period
to which the particular portions of this book belong. But such an undertaking is
wholly vain in the case before us, as well as in that of Micah, and most of the
minor prophets generally. The supposition upon which it rests is false&mdash;viz., that
the collection consists of a number of single, detached portions. We do not possess
the whole of Hosea&#39;s prophecies, but only the substance of their essential contents,&mdash;a
survey which he himself gave towards the end of his ministry. This appears (1) from
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> in the inscription. In itself,
this would not be a decisive argument, as the prophet might also have comprehended
in an <i>ideal</i> unity, discourses outwardly distinct; but, nevertheless, as long
as no reason appears for the contrary, it is more naturally referred to a continuous
discourse with an external unity also. (2.) It appears from the entire omission
of all chronological data. The only exception is in ver. 2; but this exception serves
only to strengthen the argument drawn from the omission everywhere else. (3.) It
is proved by the absence of all certain indications about the beginning and ending
of the particular portions. There occur, just as in the second part of Isaiah, new
starting points only; but, with these exceptions, the discourse always moves on
in the same manner. (4.) It is seen from the indefiniteness and generality of the
historical references, which must necessarily arise if the prophet referred, in
like manner, to the whole of this lengthened period. That the facts, upon which
the last two arguments rest, really exist, is made sufficiently apparent from the
immense diversity of opinions as to the number and extent of the particular portions,
and as to the time of their composition. There are not even two of the more important
interpreters who agree in the main points alone. Such a diversity does not exist
in reference to any of the prophetical books which actually consist of detached
prophecies. (5.) The style and language are too much the same throughout the whole,
to admit of the idea that any long period could have elapsed between the particular
prophecies. This, indeed, is only a subordinate argument; but it acquires its full
importance, when connected with the foundation of the third and fourth proofs.</p>
<p class="normal">It now only remains to give a survey of the historical circumstances
at the time of the prophet. This is the more necessary, as a knowledge of these
is required for the exposition of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span> the Messianic
prophecies, not only of Hosea, but also of Amos, his contemporary.</p>
<p class="normal">The kingdom of Israel carried within it, from its very commencement,
a twofold element of destruction&mdash;viz., the establishment of the worship of the calves,
and the rebellion against the dynasty of David. With regard to the former,&mdash;the consequence
of this apparently so much isolated transgression of a Mosaic ordinance extended
much further than would appear upon a superficial view. In this case also it was
seen that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. Of far higher importance than
the low conceptions of God produced by this symbolical representation of Him, was
another aspect of the transaction. The prohibition of image-worship in the Pentateuch
was as distinct and clear as it was possible to make it. The kings of Israel were
far from rejecting it; but still, how difficult soever it may appear, they found
out an interpretation by which they evaded the application of it to their institution.
Such a course once entered upon, could only lead them further and further astray.
As, in so important a case, they had, in opposition to their own better convictions,
allowed themselves to pervert and explain away the law&mdash;asserting, probably, that
it was given only on account of the coarse sensuality of former generations&mdash;the
same was done in other things also, as often as it was called for by the disposition
of the corrupted heart. All unfaithfulness which is known to be so, and yet is cherished,
and excused to the conscience and before men, must draw after it entire ruin, in
a community, not less than in an individual. As a reason for this ruin, it is very
strikingly said in 2 Kings xvii. 9: &quot;And they <i>covered</i> (this is the only ascertained
signification of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1508;&#1488;</span>) words that were not
so, over the Lord their God;&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, they ventured, by a number of perversions
and false interpretations of His word, to veil its true form. To this, the following
consideration must be added:&mdash;That first change of the religious institutions proceeded
from the political power which secured to itself, for the future, an absolute influence
upon the religious affairs, by subjecting to its control the ecclesiastical power,
which had hitherto been independent of it. Those Levites who, having no regard to
the miserable sophisms invented by the king as an excuse, declared against the worship
of calves, were expelled, and, in their stead, creatures of the king
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span> were made ministers of the sanctuary. This
became now the king&#39;s sanctuary (compare the remarkable passage, Amos vii. 13),
and all the ecclesiastical affairs were, in strict contradiction to the Mosaic law,
submitted to his arbitrary power. The consequences of this must necessarily have
been all the sadder, the worse the kings were; and they must inevitably have become
so, because of the bad foundation on which the royal power rested.</p>
<p class="normal">Image-worship was very speedily followed by idolatry,&mdash;which is,
however, in like manner, not to be looked upon in the light of an undisguised opposition
to the true God. Such an opposition took place during the reign of only one king&mdash;Ahab&mdash;under
whom the matter was carried to an extreme. Holy Scripture, however, with a total
disregard of the whole multitude of miserable excuses ordinarily made, designates
as <i>direct</i> apostasy from God, everything which was substantially such, although
it did not outwardly manifest itself as such. Externally, they remained faithful
to Jehovah; they celebrated His feasts,&mdash;they offered the sacrifices prescribed in
the Pentateuch,&mdash;they regulated, in general, all the religious institutions according
to the requirements there laid down, as may be proved from the Books of Kings, and,
still more plainly, from Amos and Hosea. But in all this they discovered a method
by which light and darkness, the worship of idols with that of the Lord, might be
combined. Nor was this discovery so very difficult, since their eye was not single.
They had before them the examples of heathen nations, who were quite prepared reciprocally
to acknowledge their deities, in all of whom they recognised only different forms
of manifestation of one and the same divine being; and they were quite willing to
extend this acknowledgment even to the God of Israel also, as long as they did not
meet with intolerance on the part of those who professed to worship Him, and were
therefore not roused to the practice of intolerance in return. This reciprocal recognition
of their deities by the nations in the midst of whom the Israelites lived, is sufficiently
evident from the circumstance, that they all called their highest deity by the same
name&mdash;Baal&mdash;and expressed, by some epithet, only the form of manifestation peculiar
to each. Now, the Israelites imagined that they might be able, at one and the same
time, to satisfy the demands of their God, and to propitiate
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span> the idols of the neighbouring mighty nations&mdash;especially
of the Ph&#339;nicians&mdash;if they removed the wall of separation betwixt the two. Jehovah
and Baal were, in their view, identical as to their essence. The former was that
mode of manifestation peculiar to them, and the main object of their worship according
to the method prescribed by Himself in His revelation. But the latter was not to
be neglected; inasmuch as they imagined that they might thereby become partakers
of the blessings which this form of manifestation of the deity was able to bestow.
And thus to Jehovah they gave the name of Baal also, Hos. ii. 18 (16); they celebrated
the days appointed by Jehovah, ver. 13 (11), but those also devoted to Baalim, ver.
15 (13). In this way we receive an explanation of the fact which, at first sight,
is so startling, viz., that according to Hosea and Amos, all is filled with the
service of Baal; while the Books of Kings would lead us to think that, with the
reign of Ahab, the dominion of this worship had ceased. But it was only its hostile
opposition to the worship of Jehovah that had disappeared, while a far more dangerous
religious compromise took its place. No doubt can be entertained as to the party
on whose side lay the advantage in this compromise. It was plainly on that side
on which it always lies, whensoever the heart is divided betwixt truth and falsehood.
Externally, the worship of Jehovah remained the prevailing one; but, inwardly, idolatry
obtained almost the sole dominion. If only the limits betwixt the two religions
were removed, that religion would of course come with the highest recommendation,
the spirit of which was most in accordance with the spirit of the people. But, owing
to the corrupt condition of human nature, this would not be the strict religion
of Jehovah, which, as coming from God, did not bring God down to the level of human
debasement, but demanded that man should be raised to His elevation,&mdash;which placed
the holiness of God in the centre, and founded upon it the requirement that its
possessors should be holy;&mdash;but it would be the soft, sensual, idolatrous doctrine
which flattered human corruption, because from that it had its origin. Thus the
Jehovah of the Israelites became in reality what they sometimes called Him by way
of alternation&mdash;a Baal. And the matter was now much more dangerous than if they had
deserted Him <span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span> externally also, inasmuch as
they now continued to trust in His covenant and promises, and to boast of their
external services,&mdash;thus strengthening themselves in their false security.</p>
<p class="normal">The <i>natural</i> consequence of this apostasy from the Lord
was a frightful corruption of manners. The next result of spiritual adultery was
the carnal one. Voluptuousness formed the fundamental characteristic of the Asiatic
religions in general, and, in particular, of those with which the Israelites came
in contact. But the pernicious influence extended still further over the whole moral
territory. Where there is no holy God, neither will there be any effort of man after
holiness. All divine and human laws will be trampled under foot. All the bonds of
love, law, and order, will be broken. And, as such, the condition of the country
in a moral point of view is described by its two prophets throughout. Compare,
<i>e.g.</i>, Hosea iv. 1, 2: &quot;There is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God
in the land. Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery&mdash;they
break through, and blood toucheth blood.&quot; There then followed, from the moral corruption,
the internal dissolution of the state, and its external weakness.</p>
<p class="normal">The <i>supernatural</i> consequences of the apostasy from the
Lord, were the severe punishments which He inflicted upon the people. With whomsoever
God has entered into a closer connection, whomsoever He thinks worthy of His grace,
in him the Lord will be glorified by the infliction of punishment upon him, if,
through his own guilt. He has not been glorified by sanctification in him. Just
because Israel formed part of the Covenant-people, they could not be allowed to
continue to retain the outward appearance of it, when, inwardly, they did not retain
a vestige.</p>
<p class="normal">As the second element of the ruin, we mentioned the rebellion
against the dynasty of David. Their dominion rested on divine right, while the new
Israelitish kingdom rested upon the sandy foundation of human caprice. The first
king had raised himself to the throne by his own power and prudence, and through
the favour of the people. Whosoever had the same means at his disposal, imagined
that these gave him the right to do likewise. And thus dynasty supplanted dynasty,
regicide followed regicide. In the bloody struggles thereby occasioned, the people
became more and more lawless. Sometimes interregna, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
and periods of total anarchy took place; and by these internal struggles the power
to resist external enemies was more and more broken. No king was able to stop this
source of mischief, for such an effort would have required him to lay aside his
position as a king. And as little was any one able to put a stop to that source
of evil formerly mentioned: for, if the religious wall of partition which was erected
between Israel and Judah were once removed, the civil one likewise threatened to
fall.</p>
<p class="normal">Such were, in general, the circumstances under which Hosea, like
the other prophets of the kingdom of Israel, appeared. There cannot be any doubt
that these were much more difficult than those of the kingdom of Judah. There, too,
the corruption was indeed very great; but it was not so firmly intertwined with
the foundation of the whole state. Thorough-going reforms, like those under Hezekiah
and Josiah, were possible. The interest of a whole tribe was closely bound up with
the preservation of true religion.</p>
<p class="normal">The reign of Jeroboam II., which was externally so prosperous,
and in which Hosea entered upon his prophetic ministry, had still more increased
the apostasy from the Lord, and the corruption of manners, and thus laid the foundation
for the series of disastrous events which began soon after his death, and which,
in quick succession, brought the people to total ruin. The prosperity only confirmed
them still more in their security. Instead of being led to repentance by the unmerited
mercy of God (compare 2 Kings xiv. 26, 27), they considered this prosperity as a
reward of their apostasy, as the seal by which Jehovah-Baal confirmed the rectitude
of their ways. The false prophets, too, did what was in their power to strengthen
them in their delusion, whilst the true prophets preached to deaf ears.</p>
<p class="normal">Immediately after the death of Jeroboam, it soon became apparent
on which side the truth lay. There followed an interregnum of from eleven to twelve
years.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_179a" href="#ftn_179a">[1]</a></sup> After
the termination <span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span> of it, Zachariah, the son
of Jeroboam, succeeded to the throne; but he was murdered by Shallum, after a short
reign of six months, 2 Kings xv. 10. Shallum, after he had reigned only one month,
was slain by Menahem, ver. 14. Menahem reigned ten years at Samaria. Under him,
the catastrophe was already preparing which brought the kingdom to utter destruction.
He became tributary to the Assyrian king Pul, vers. 19-21. He was succeeded by his
son Pekahiah, in the fiftieth year of Uzziah. After a reign of two months, he was
slain by Pekah, the son of Remaliah, who held the government for twenty years (ver.
27), and, by his alliance with the kings of Syria against his brethren the people
of Judah (comp. Is. vii.), hastened on the destruction of Israel. The Assyrians,
under Tiglathpileser, called to his assistance by Ahaz, even at that time carried
away into captivity part of its citizens,&mdash;the tribes who lived on the other side
of the Jordan. In the fourth year of Ahaz, Pekah was slain by Hoshea, who, after
an interregnum of eight years, began to reign in the twelfth year of Ahaz, xvii.
1. He became tributary to Shalmaneser; and the end of his government of nine years
was also the end of the kingdom of the ten tribes. His having sought for an alliance
with Egypt drew down, upon himself and his people, the vengeance of the king of
Assyria.</p>
<p class="normal">We have already proved that the historical references in the prophecies
of Hosea extend to the time when the last king of Israel attempted to secure himself
against Asshur, by the alliance with Egypt. It is very probable that the book was
written at <span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span> that time. At the time when the
sword of the Lord was just being raised to inflict upon Israel the death-blow, Hosea
wrote down the sum and substance of what he had prophesied during a long series
of years, beginning in the last times of Jeroboam, when, to a superficial view,
the people were in the enjoyment of the fullest prosperity. When at the threshold
of their final fulfilment, he condensed and wrote down his prophecies, just as,
in the <i>annus fatalis</i>, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah, according to
chap. xxv., gave a survey of what he had prophesied over Judah during twenty-three
years.</p>
<p class="normal">In the prophecies of Hosea, as in those of Amos, the <i>threatening</i>
character prevails. The number of the elect in Israel was small, and the judgment
was at hand. In Jeremiah and Ezekiel, too, the prophecies, previous to the destruction,
are mainly minatory. It was only after the wrath of God had been manifested in deeds,
that the stream of promise brake forth without hindrance. Hosea, nevertheless, does
not belie his name, by which he had been dedicated to the helping and saving God,
and which he had received, <i>non sine numine</i>. (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1506;</span>,
properly the Inf. Abs. of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1506;</span>, is, in substance,
equivalent to Joshua, <i>i.e.</i>, the Lord is help.) Zeal for the Lord fills and
animates him, not only in the energy of his threatenings, but also in the intensity
and strength of his conviction of the pardoning mercy and healing love of the Lord,
which will, in the end, prevail. In this respect, Hosea is closely connected with
the Song of Solomon&mdash;that link in the chain of Holy Scripture into which he had,
in the first instance, to fit. There are in Hosea undeniable references to the Song
of Solomon. (Compare my Comment. on the Song of Solomon, on chap. i. 4, ii. 3.)
It is certainly not by accident that the brighter views appear with special clearness
at the beginning, in chap. i. 3 (compare ii. 1-3, 16-25 [i. 10, ii. 1, 14-23], iii.
5), and at the close, xiv. 2-10 (1-9), where the fundamental thought is expressed
in ver. 4 (3): &quot;For in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.&quot; But even in the darker
middle portions, they sometimes suddenly break through; compare v. 15, vi. 3, where
the subject is: &quot;He teareth and He healeth us; He smiteth and He bindeth up;&quot; vi.
11, where, after the threatening against Israel, we suddenly find the words: &quot;Nevertheless,
O Judah! He grants thee a harvest, when I (<i>i.e.</i>, the Lord) return to the
prison of My people.&quot; (Judah is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span> here mentioned
as the main portion of the people, in whom mercy is bestowed upon the whole, and
in whose salvation the other tribes also share.) Compare also xi. 8-11, where we
have this thought: After wrath, mercy; the Covenant-people can never, like the world,
be altogether borne down by destructive judgments; xiii. 14, where the strong conviction
of the absolutely imperishable nature of the Congregation of the Lord finds utterance
in the words, &quot;I will ransom them from the hand of hell; I will redeem them from
death: O death! where is thy plague? O hell! where is thy pestilence? repentance
is hid from Mine eyes.&quot; <i>Simson</i> is perplexed &quot;by the sudden transition of
the discourse, in this passage, from threatening to promise,&mdash;and this without even
any particle to indicate the mutual relation of the sentences and thoughts.&quot; But
the same phenomenon occurs also in vi. 11 (compare Micah ii. 12, 13), where, likewise,
several expositors are perplexed by the suddenness and abruptness of the transition.
It is explained from the circumstance, that behind even the darkest clouds of wrath
which have gathered over the Congregation of the Lord, there is, nevertheless, concealed
the sun of mercy. In the prophets, it sometimes breaks through suddenly and abruptly;
but in this they are at one with history, in which the deepest darkness of the night
is oftentimes suddenly illuminated by the shining of the Lord: &quot;And at midnight
there was a cry made: Behold, the bridegroom cometh.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The sum and substance of Hosea&#39;s prophetic announcement is the
following:&mdash;Israel falls, through Asshur: Judah, the main tribe, shall be preserved
from destruction in this catastrophe. (The prophet&#39;s tender care for Judah is strikingly
brought out in his exhortation to Israel, in iv. 15, that they should desist from
their compromises in religion, and that, if they chose to commit sin, they should
rather desert the Lord altogether, lest by their hypocrisy Judah also should be
seduced and infected.) But at a later period, Judah too is to fall under the divine
judgment (ii. 2 [i. 11], where it is supposed that Judah shall also be carried away
into captivity; v. 5: &quot;Israel and Ephraim fall by their iniquity, Judah also falleth
with them;&quot; v. 12: &quot;I am unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness;&quot;
compare also xii. 1, 3), although the immediate instruments of the judgment upon
Judah are not mentioned <span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span> by Hosea. But the
judgments which the two houses of Israel draw upon themselves by their works (ii.
2 [i. 11], iii. 5, indicate that even Judah will, at some future time, rebel against
the house of David) shall be followed by the deliverance to be accomplished by grace.
Judah and Israel shall, in the future, be again gathered together under one head,
ii. 2 (i. 11); a glorious king out of David&#39;s house not only restores what was lost,
but also raises the Congregation of the Lord to a decree of glory never before conceived
of, iii. 5: &quot;Afterwards shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their
God, and David their King, and shall fear the Lord and His goodness in the latter
days.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The peculiarity of the Messianic prophecies of Hosea, as compared
with those of the time of David and Solomon, consists in the connection of the promise
with threatenings of judgments, and in the Messiah&#39;s appearing as the light of those
who walk in the deepest darkness of the divine judgments. It was necessary that
this progress should have been made in the Messianic announcements, before the breaking
in of the divine judgments; for, otherwise, the hope of the Messiah would have been
extinguished by them, because it was but too natural to consider the former as,
<i>in fact</i>, an annihilation of these dreamy hopes. But now there was offered
to the elect a staff on which they might support themselves, and walk with confidence
through the dark valley of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="normal">The Book of Hosea may be divided into two parts, according to
the two principal periods of the prophet&#39;s ministry,&mdash;under Jeroboam, when the external
condition was as yet prosperous, and the bodily eye did not as yet perceive anything
of the storms of divine wrath which were gathering,&mdash;and under the following kings,
down to Hosea, when the punishment had already begun, and was hastening, by rapid
strides, towards its consummation.&mdash;Another difference, although a subordinate one,
is this:&mdash;that the first part, which comprehends the first three chapters, contains
prophecies connected with a symbol, while the second part contains direct prophecies
which have no such connection. A similar division occurs in Amos also,&mdash;with this
difference, that there, the symbolical prophecies form the conclusion. The first
part may be considered as a kind of outline, which all the subsequent prophecies
served to fill up; just <span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span> as may the 6th chapter
in Isaiah, and the first and second in Ezekiel. We shall give a complete exposition
of this section, as it will afford us a vivid view of the whole position of Hosea,
and as it is just there that the Messianic announcement meets us in its most developed
form.</p>

<hr class="W20">
<h3><a name="div3_184" href="#div3Ref_184">THE SECTION CHAP. I.-III.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The question which here above all engages our attention, and requires
to be answered, is this: Whether that which is reported in these chapters did, or
did not, actually and outwardly take place. The history of the inquiries connected
with this question is found most fully in <i>Marckius&#39;s</i> &quot;<i>Diatribe de uxore
fornicationum</i>,&quot; Leyden, 1696, reprinted in the Commentary on the Minor Prophets
by the same author. The various views may be divided into three classes.</p>
<p class="normal">1. It is maintained by very many interpreters, that all the events
here narrated took place actually and outwardly. This opinion was advanced with
the greatest confidence by <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>Cyril</i> of Alexandria, and <i>
Augustine</i> from among the Fathers of the Church; by most interpreters belonging
to the Lutheran and Reformed Churches (<i>e.g. Manger</i>); most recently, by <i>
Stuck</i>, <i>Hofmann</i> (<i>Weissag u. Erf.</i> S. 206), and, to a certain extent,
by <i>Ewald</i> also, who supposes &quot;a free representation of an event actually experienced
by the prophet.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">2. Others consider it as a parabolical representation. Thus does
Calvin, who expressly opposes the supposition not only of an external, but also
of an internal event. He explains it thus: &quot;When the prophet began to teach, he
commenced thus: The Lord has placed me here as on a stage, that I might tell you,
I have taken a wife,&quot; etc. Entirely similar was the opinion of the Chaldee Paraphrast,
by whom the words, &quot;Go,&quot; etc., are thus paraphrased: &quot;Go and prophesy against the
inhabitants of the adulterous city.&quot; Of a like purport is the view held, from among
recent interpreters, by <i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Hitzig</i> (&quot;that which the prophet
describes as actual, is only a fiction&quot;), <i>Simson</i> and others. The strange
opinion of Luther, which, out of too great respect, was adopted by a few later theologians
(<i>Osiander</i>, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span> <i>Gerhard</i>, <i>Tarnovius</i>),
is only a modification of this. It is to the effect, that the prophet had only ascribed
to his own chaste wife the name and works of an adulteress, and, hence, had performed
with her, before the people, a kind of play. (Compare, against this view, <i>Buddeus</i>,
<i>de peccatis typicis</i> in the <i>Misc. s. t.</i> i. p. 262.) The same opinion
is expressed by <i>Umbreit</i>: &quot;His own wife is implicated in the general guilt,
and hence she is a representative of the whole people.&quot; In opposition to this view,
compare <i>Simson&#39;s</i> Commentary.</p>
<p class="normal">3. Others suppose that the prophet narrates events which took
place <i>actually</i>, indeed, but <i>not outwardly</i>. This opinion was, considering
the time at which it was advanced, very ably defended by <i>Jerome</i> in <i>Epist.
ad Pammachium</i>, and in his commentary on chap. i. 8. According to <i>Rufinus</i>,
all those in Palestine and Egypt who respected the authority of <i>Origen</i>, asserted
that the marriage took place only in spirit. The difficulties attaching to the first
view were made especially obvious by the ridicule of the Manicheans (<i>Faustus</i>
and <i>Secundinus</i> in <i>Augustine</i>, t. vi. p. 575) on this narrative. The
most accomplished Jewish scholars (<i>Maimonides</i> in the <i>More Nebuch.</i>
p. ii. c. 46, <i>Abenezra</i>, <i>Kimchi</i>) support this opinion. Some new arguments
in defence of it have been adduced by <i>Marckius</i>.</p>
<p class="normal">Of these three views:&mdash;actually and outwardly; neither outwardly
nor actually; actually, but not outwardly,&mdash;the second must be at once rejected.
Those who hold it supply, &quot;God has commanded me to tell you.&quot; But there is not the
slightest intimation of such an ellipsis; and those interpreters have no better
right to supply it in this, than in any other narrative. There is before us action,
and nothing but action, without any intimation whatsoever that it is merely an invention.</p>
<p class="normal">But the following arguments are decisive in favour of the third,
and against the first view.</p>
<p class="normal">1. The defenders of an outward transaction rely, in support of
their view, upon the supposition, that their interpretation is most obvious and
natural;&mdash;that they are thus, as it were, in the <i>possession</i> of the ground,
and in a position from which they can be driven only by the most cogent reasons;&mdash;that
if the transaction had been internal, it would have been necessary for the prophet
to have expressly marked it as such. But precisely the reverse of all this is the
case. The most obvious supposition <span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span> is, that
the symbolical action took place in vision. If <i>certain</i> actions of the prophets,
especially seeing, hearing, and their speaking to the Lord, etc., must be conceived
of as having taken place inwardly, unless there be distinct indications of the opposite,
why not the remainder also? For the former presupposes that the world in which the
prophets move, is altogether different from the ordinary one; that it is not the
outward, but the spiritual world. It is certainly not a matter of chance, that the
<i>seeing</i> in the case of the prophets must be understood spiritually; and if
there be a reason for this, the same reason entitles us to assert that the walking,
etc., also took place inwardly only. By what right could we make any difference
between the actions of others, described by the prophet, and his own? Vision and
symbolical action are not opposed to each other; the former is only the <i>genus</i>
comprehending the latter as a <i>species</i>. By this we do not at all mean to assert,
that <i>all</i> the symbolical actions of the prophets took place in inward vision
only. An inward transaction always lay at the foundation; but sometimes, and when
it was appropriate, they embodied it in an outward representation also (1 Kings
xx. 35 seq., xxii. 11; Jer. xix. xxviii.; and a similar remarkable instance from
modern times, in <i>Croesi Hist. Quakeriana</i>, p. 13). For this very reason, however,
this argument cannot be altogether decisive by itself; but it furnishes, at least,
a presumptive proof, and that by no means unimportant. If regularly and naturally
the transaction be internal only, then the opposite requires to be proved in this
case. If this had been admitted, no attempt would have been made elsewhere also,
<i>e.g.</i>, Is. xx., by false and forced interpretations to explain away the supposition
of a merely internal transaction.</p>
<p class="normal">2. No one will certainly venture to assert that a merely internal
transaction would have missed its aim, since there exists a multitude of symbolical
actions, in regard to which it is undeniable, and universally admitted, that they
took place internally only. For the inward action, being narrated and committed
to writing, retained the advantage of vividness and impressiveness over the naked
representation of the same truth. Sometimes, in the case of actions concentrated
into a single moment, this advantage may be still further increased by the inward
transaction being represented outwardly also. But, here, just the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span> opposite would take place. We have here before
us a symbolical transaction which, if it had been performed outwardly, would have
continued for several years. The separation of the single events would have prevented
its being taken in at a single view, and have thus deprived it of its impressiveness.
But, what is still more important, the natural <i>substratum</i> would have occupied
the attention so much more than the <i>idea</i>, that the latter would have been
thereby altogether overlooked. The domestic affairs of the prophet would have become
the subject of a large amount of <i>tittle-tattle</i>, and the idea would have been
remembered only to give greater point to the ridicule.</p>
<p class="normal">3. The command of God, when considered as referring to an outward
transaction, cannot be, by any means, justified. This is most glaringly obvious,
if we understand this command, as several do, to mean that the prophet should beget
children with an unchaste woman, and without legitimate marriage. Every one will
sympathize with the indignation expressed by <i>Buddeus</i> (l. c. p. 206) against
<i>Thomas Aquinas</i>, who, following this view, maintains that the law of God had
been, in this special case, repealed by His command. God Himself cannot set us free
from His commands; they are an expression of His nature, an image of His holiness.
To ascribe arbitrariness to God in this respect, would be to annihilate the idea
of God, and the idea of the Law at the same time. This view, it is true, is so decidedly
erroneous as to require no further refutation; but even the opinion of <i>Buddeus</i>
and others presents insurmountable difficulties. They suppose that the prophet had
married a woman who was formerly unchaste. In opposition to this, Calvin very strikingly
remarks: &quot;It seems not to be consistent with reason, that God should spontaneously
have rendered His prophet contemptible; for how could he ever have appeared in public
after such ignominy had been inflicted upon him? If he had married such a wife,
as here described, he ought rather to have hidden himself all his lifetime than
have assumed the prophetic office.&quot; In Lev. xxi. 7 the law forbids the priests to
take a wife that is a whore, or profane. That which, according to the letter, referred
to the priests only, is applicable, in its spirit, to the prophets also,&mdash;yea, to
them in a higher degree, as will be seen immediately, when the ordinance is reduced
to its <i>idea</i>. The latter is easily inferred from the reason stated,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span> viz., that the priests should be holy to their
God. The servants of God must represent His holiness; they are, therefore, not allowed,
by so close a contact with sin, to defile or desecrate themselves either inwardly
or outwardly. Although the inward pollution may be prevented in individual cases
by a specially effective assistance of divine grace, yet there always remains the
outward pollution.</p>
<p class="normal">It is inconceivable that, at the very commencement of his ministry,
God should have commanded to the prophet anything, the inevitable effect of which
was to mar its successful execution. Several&mdash;and especially <i>Manger</i>&mdash;who felt
the difficulties of this interpretation, substituted for it another, by which, as
they imagined, all objections were removed. The prophet, they say, married a person
who had formerly been chaste, and fell only after her marriage. This view is no
doubt the correct one, as is obvious from the relation of the figure to the reality.
According to ver. 2, it is to be expressed figuratively that the people went a-whoring
from Jehovah. The spiritual adultery presupposes that the spiritual marriage had
already been concluded. Hence, the wife can be called a whoring wife, only on account
of the whoredom which she practised after her marriage. This is confirmed by chap.
iii. 1, where the more limited expression &quot;to commit adultery&quot; is substituted for
&quot;to whore,&quot; which has a wider sense, and comprehends adultery also. The former unchastity
of the wife would be without any meaning, yea, would be in direct contradiction
to the real state of the case. For before the marriage concluded at Sinai, Israel
was devoted to the Lord in faithful love; comp. Jer. ii. 2: &quot;I remember thee, the
kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, thy walking after Me in the
wilderness, in a land not sown.&quot; Compare also Ezek. xvi., where Israel, before her
marriage, appears as a <i>virgo intacta</i>. But how correct soever this view may
be&mdash;and every other view perverts the whole position&mdash;it is, nevertheless, erroneous
to suppose that thereby all difficulties are removed. All which has been urged against
the former view, may be urged here also. It might have been better for the prophet
to have married one who was previously unchaste, in the hope that her subsequent
better life might wipe out her former shame, than one previously chaste, who <i>
was required</i> to become unchaste, and to remain so for a long time, because,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span> otherwise, the symbolical action would have
lost all its significance. The objection brought forward, that whatever is unbecoming
as an outward action, is so likewise though it were only an internal action, can
scarcely be meant to be in earnest. For, in this case, every one knew that the prophet
was a mere type; and, with regard to his wife, this circumstance was so obvious,
that mockery certainly gave way to shame and confusion. But a marriage outwardly
entered into is never purely typical. It has always its significance apart from
the typical import, and must be justifiable, independently of its typical character.
Ridicule would, in this case, have been not only too obvious, but to a certain extent
also well founded. </p>
<p class="normal">4. If the action had taken place only outwardly, it would have
been impossible to explain the abrupt transition from the symbolical action to the
mere figure, and again to the entirely naked representation as we find it here,
and <i>vice versa</i>. In the first chapter, the symbolical action is pretty well
maintained; but in the prophecy ii. 1-3 (i. 10-ii. 1), which belongs to the same
section, it is almost entirely lost sight of. As the corporeal adultery, and rejection
in consequence of it, were to be the type of the spiritual adultery and rejection,
so the receiving again of the wife, rejected on account of her faithlessness, but
now reformed, was to typify the Lord&#39;s granting mercy to the people. But of this,
not a trace is found. And yet, we are not at liberty to say that the ground of it
lies in a difference betwixt the type and the thing typified,&mdash;in the circumstance
that the wife of the prophet did not reform. If there existed such a difference,
the type could not have been chosen at all. The contrary appears also from ii. 9
(7).&mdash;In the whole second section, ii. 4-25 (ii. 2-23), regard is indeed had to the
symbolical action; but in a manner so free, that it dwindles away to a mere figure,
from behind which the thing itself is continually coming into view. In chap. iii.
the symbolical action again acquires greater prominence. These phenomena can be
accounted for, only if the transaction be viewed as an inward one. In the case of
an outward transaction, the transition from the symbolical action to the figure,
and from the figure to the thing itself, would not have been so easy. The substratum
of the idea is, in that case, far more material, and the idea itself too closely
bound to it.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span></p>
<p class="normal">5. When the transaction is viewed as an outward one, insurmountable
difficulties are presented by the third chapter; and the argument drawn from this
would, in itself, be quite sufficient to settle the question: &quot;Then the Lord said
unto me. Go again, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress.&quot; Interpreters
who have adopted that view, find themselves here in no little embarrassment. Several
suppose that the woman, whom the prophet is here commanded to love, is his former
wife, Gomer,&mdash;with her he should get reconciled. But this is quite out of the question.
In opposition to it, there is, <i>first</i>, the indefinite signification by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1492;</span>; <i>then</i>, in ver. 2, there is the
purchase of the woman,&mdash;which supposes that she had not yet been in the possession
of the husband; and, <i>further</i>, the words, &quot;beloved of her friend, and an adulteress,&quot;
can, according to a sound interpretation, mean only, &quot;who, although she is beloved
by her faithful husband, will yet commit adultery;&quot; so that, if it be referred to
the reunion with Gomer, we should be compelled to suppose that, after being received
again, she again became unfaithful,&mdash;and in favour of this opinion, no corresponding
feature can be pointed out in the thing typified. <i>Lastly</i>,&mdash;The word &quot;love&quot;
cannot mean &quot;love again,&quot; &quot;<i>restitue amoris signa</i>.&quot; For the love of the prophet
to his wife must correspond with the love of God to the people of Israel. That this
love, however, cannot be limited to the love which God will show to the Congregation
<i>after</i> her conversion, is seen from the additional clause, &quot;And they turn
themselves to other gods, and love grape-cakes.&quot; Hence it appears that the love
of God continues even during the unfaithfulness, and consequently, also, the love
of the prophet, by which it is typified.&mdash;Equally untenable is the other opinion,
that the prophet is here called upon, by his entering into a new marriage, to prefigure
the relation of God to the Covenant-people a second time. In that case, it is supposed
either that Gomer had been rejected, because she would not return, or that she had
died. In either case, however, she would not have been chosen by God to be a type
of the people of Israel. The ground of this choice can be no other than the correspondence
with the antitype. But this would be wanting just in the most important point. If
the ungodly part of the nation were not to be deprived of all hope, nor the pious
of all consolation, it was of special importance to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>
point out that even the rejected congregation would receive mercy; that the Lo-Ruhamah
should be the Ruhamah. Just the reverse of all this, however, would, according to
this view, have been typified. Two different women would, quite naturally, suggest
the thought of two different nations. Moreover, the non-conversion of Gomer would
be in direct opposition to the prophet&#39;s own expressions. There cannot be any doubt,
that her relation to the prophet still lies at the foundation of the description
in ii. 4 seqq. For they are her three children whose former names, announcing disaster,
are changed, in ver. 25 (23), into such as are significant of salvation. In vers.
4-6 (2-4) the whole relation, as previously described, is presupposed. But now,
she who, in ver. 9 (7), says, &quot;I will go and return to my first husband, for then
was it better with me than now,&quot; is the same who said in ver. 7 (5), &quot;I will go
after my lovers that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax.&quot; To the
same result we are also led by the showing of mercy to her children, announced in
the first section, ii. 1-3 (i. 10-ii. 1), where the prophet alludes to their names;
and still more distinctly in the second section; compare ver. 25 (23). But now,
the showing of mercy to the children cannot be conceived of without the conversion
of the mother, and mercy being subsequently shown to her also. As they are to be
rejected on account of the unfaithfulness of the mother (compare ii. 6 [4], and,
specially, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> at the commencement of ver.
7), so the ground of their being received into favour can only be the faithfulness
of the mother. Being begotten in adultery, they stand in connection with the prophet
only through the mother; as soon as he has rejected the mother, he has nothing further
to do with them.&mdash;The supposition that Gomer had died, is evidently the result of
an embarrassment which finds itself compelled to invent such fictions.&mdash;<i>Finally</i>,&mdash;Several
interpreters, after the example of <i>Augustine</i>, suppose that no marriage at
all is here spoken of, but only a certain kindness which the prophet should manifest
to some woman, in order to encourage her conversion. But this opinion is contradicted
by these circumstances:&mdash;that the prophet&#39;s love towards the woman must necessarily
be of the same extent, and of the same nature, as the love of God towards the people
of Israel, since the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;</span> and the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;</span> exactly correspond with each other;
that only conjugal love is suitable to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span> the
image; that this view falls, of itself, to the ground when
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</span> is referred to the prophet, as it must
be; that, in such circumstances, no satisfactory account can be given of the purchase
of the woman, etc. To all these suppositions there is, moreover, the common objection
that, according to them, no account can be given of the omission of very important
circumstances which the prophet leaves to his hearers and readers to supply from
the preceding symbolical action. Two things only are pointed out, viz., the appropriation
of the woman by the prophet, ver. 2, and the course which he pursues for her reformation,
ver. 3. Every intervening circumstance&mdash;the criminal, long-continued unfaithfulness
of the wife&mdash;is passed over in silence. If we suppose an outward action, this circumstance
cannot be accounted for. For we are not at liberty to draw, from the first case,
any inference bearing upon the second. The latter would again have required a complete
account. But if we suppose an inward transaction, everything is easily explained.
The question as to whether it was Gomer, or some other person, does not come up
at all. If Gomer was only an <i>ideal</i> person, that which applied to her was
equally applicable to the second <i>ideal</i> wife of the prophet; since both typified
the same thing, and without having an independent existence of their own, came into
consideration as types only. Thus, very naturally, the second description was supplemented
from the first, and the prophet was allowed abruptly to point out those circumstances
only which were of special importance in the case before him.</p>
<p class="normal">6. If the whole be viewed as an outward transaction, there arises
a difficulty, by no means inconsiderable, as regards the children mentioned in chap.
i. These had been begotten in adultery. Even although the mother did reform, they
could yet never be considered by the prophet as, in the full sense, his own. There
would then arise a great difference between the type and the thing typified. But
if we suppose a transaction merely inward, this difficulty vanishes. The physical
impossibility then no longer comes into consideration. That which is possible in
the thing typified, viz., that those who formerly were not children of God, become
children of God, is transferred to the type. In point of fact, the mother does not
exist beside, and apart from, the children; she stands related to them as the whole
to the parts; and hence it is, that in ii. 25 (23), the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
193]</span> mother and children are imperceptibly blended in the prophet&#39;s description.</p>
<p class="normal">7. We are led to the idea of a mere inward transaction by the
symbolical names of the first wife, and of her father. On the other hand, if such
a symbolical signification could not be proved, this might be used as an argument
for the literal interpretation,&mdash;although, indeed, it would be only a single argument
which would be obliged to yield to other counter-arguments. For it may well be conceived
that the prophet, in order to give to the inward transaction more of the appearance
of an outward one, should have chosen names usual at that time; just as, in a similar
manner, poetry would not be satisfied with invented names used only in certain formulas
and proverbs, but makes use of names which would not, at once, be recognised by
every one as mere fictions.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> can only
mean &quot;completion&quot; in the passive sense. For <i>Segolate-forms</i> in <i>o</i> are
only used to express passive and intransitive notions, and the verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1502;&#1512;</span> is found in the signification &quot;to be completed,&quot;
in Ps. vii. 10, xii. 2. The sense in which the woman, the type of the Israelitish
people, is called <i>completion</i>,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one who, in her whoredom, had
proceeded to the highest pitch,&mdash;is so obvious from the context, as to render nugatory
the argument which <i>Maurer</i> (p. 360) has drawn from the omission of express
statements on this point, in order thereby to recommend his own interpretation,
which is altogether opposed to the laws of the language. A significant proper name
can, in any case, convey only an allusion; but such an allusion was here quite sufficient,
inasmuch as the mention of the wife&#39;s whoredom had preceded. Compare, moreover,
Zech. v. 5-11, where the thought, that Israel had filled up the measure of their
sins, is represented by a woman sitting in an Ephah. <i>Hofmann</i> explains the
name Gomer by &quot;end,&quot; &quot;utmost ruin:&quot; &quot;By luxury, Israel has become wanton, and hence
it must come to an end, to utter ruin.&quot; But this interpretation is at variance with
the context, from which it must necessarily be derived; for it is not the <i>punishment</i>,
but the <i>guilt</i> which is spoken of in the context.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1502;&#1512;</span>, &quot;Completion&quot; (compare the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, &quot;<i>perfectus</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>absolutus</i>,&quot;
in Ezra vii. 12), is equivalent to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1514; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
&quot;a wife of whoredom.&quot; The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514; &#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span> can only
mean, &quot;daughter of the two fig-cakes,&quot; = <i>filia deliciarum</i> = <i>deliciis</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span> <i>dedita</i>. The word &quot;daughter&quot; serves
to indicate every relation of dependence and submission: <i>Gesenius</i>, <i>Thesaurus</i>,
p. 220. Fig-cakes were considered as one of the greatest dainties; compare <i>Faber</i>
on <i>Harmar</i>. i. p. 320 ff. Sensuality was the ground of the Israelites&#39; apostasy
from the severe and strict religion of Jehovah to the idolatry of their neighbours,
which was soft, sensual, and licentious. The occasion which had called it forth
with their neighbours was one which rendered them favourably disposed towards it.
The masculine form can offer no difficulty as to the derivation from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, &quot;fig-cake;&quot; for the masculine form of
the plural occurs also in 1 Sam. xxv. 18; 1 Chron. xii. 40. As little difficulty
can arise from the Dual form, which may be explained from the circumstance that
fig-cakes commonly consisted of a double layer of figs, or of double cakes (<i>Hesych.</i>
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#8049;&#952;&#951;</span>&mdash;which Greek word is a corruption of
the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;</span>&mdash;<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7969;
&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#8059;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#8049;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#952;&#8051;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), and the Dual is used in reference to objects
which are commonly conceived of as a whole, consisting of two parts, even when several
of them are spoken of. That this explanation of the Dual is correct, is proved from
the circumstance, that it occurs also as the name of a Moabitish town, <i>Beth-Dibhlathaim</i>,
Jer. xlviii. 22, and <i>Dibhlathaim</i>, Num. xxxiii. 46, which, probably, was famous
for its fig-cakes.&mdash;There existed another special reason for the prophet&#39;s choosing
the Dual in the masculine form, viz., that there was the analogy of other proper
names of men&mdash;as Ephraim, etc.&mdash;in its favour; and such an analogy was required,&mdash;for,
otherwise, the name would not have been, as it was intended to be, a riddle. Our
whole exposition, however, which was already in substance, although without proper
foundation and justification, advanced by <i>Jerome</i>, is raised above the condition
of a mere hypothesis, by its being compared with chap. iii. There, the words, &quot;They
turn themselves to other gods, and love grape-cakes,&quot; are a mere paraphrasis of
&quot;<i>Gomer Bath Dibhlaim</i>.&quot; It scarcely needs to be remarked, that the difference
betwixt grape-cakes and fig-cakes does not here come into consideration at all,
inasmuch as both belonged to the choicest dainties; and it is as evident, that &quot;to
love,&quot; and &quot;to be the daughter of,&quot; express the same idea. But if thus the symbolical
signification of the name be established, the correctness of the supposition of
a merely internal transaction is established <span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
at the same time. The symbolical names of the children alone could not have furnished
a sufficient foundation for this supposition. Against this an appeal might, with
the most perfect propriety, have been made to <i>Shear-Jashub</i>, and <i>Maher-shalal-hash-baz</i>,
neither of whom can, by any means, have been an ideal person. The prophet gave them
these names; but the matter is quite different in the case of the wife, who already
had her name when the prophet took her. All that we can grant to <i>Hofmann</i>
is, that such a providential coincidence was <i>possible</i>; but <i>probable</i>
it could be, only if other decisive arguments favoured the view of the transaction
having been an outward one. If the name were not symbolical&mdash;if it belonged to the
real wife of the prophet, it cannot be easily explained, why he did not afterwards
mention the name of his second wife also, but content himself with the general term,
&quot;a wife.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">8. A main argument against the literal interpretation is further
furnished by iii. 2. The verse is commonly translated: &quot;And then I bought her to
me for fifteen pieces of silver, and an homer of barley, and a lethech of barley;&quot;
and is explained from the custom prevalent in the East of purchasing wives from
their parents. But it is very doubtful whether the verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;</span> has the signification &quot;to purchase.&quot; There
is no necessity for deviating from the common signification &quot;to dig,&quot; in Deut. ii.
6: &quot;And water also ye shall dig from them for money, and drink&quot; (compare Exod. xxi.
33); the existing wells were not sufficient for so great a multitude, compare Gen.
xxvi. 19, 21, 22. To this philological reason, we must <i>further</i> add, that
the circumstance would be here altogether destitute of significance, while every
other feature in the description is full of meaning. We base our interpretation
upon the supposition, already sufficiently established by <i>J. D. Michaelis</i>,
that the whole purchase-money amounted to thirty shekels, of which the prophet paid
one-half in money, and the other half in the value of money. According to Ezek.
xlv. 11, the homer contained ten ephahs, and a lethech was the half of an homer.
We have thus fifteen pieces of silver, and also fifteen ephahs; and the supposition
is very probable that, at that time, an ephah of barley cost a shekel,&mdash;the more
so, as according to 2 Kings vii. 1, 16, 18, in the time of a declining famine, and
only relative cheapness, two-thirds of an ephah of barley cost a shekel. We are
unable <span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span> to say with certainty, why one-half
was paid in money, and the other half in natural productions; but a reason certainly
exists, as no other feature is without significance. Perhaps it was determined by
custom, that the sum by which servants were purchased was paid after this manner.
The lowness of their condition was thereby indicated; for barley, <i>vile hordeum</i>,
was, in all antiquity, very little esteemed. Upon this estimate of it was based
its use at the jealousy offering (Num. v. 11 seqq.; compare <i>Bähr&#39;s Symb.</i>
ii. S. 445), and the symbolical use of the barley-bread in Judg. vii. 13. The statement
of the sum leads us, involuntarily, to think of slaves or servants. It is the same
sum which was commonly given for a man-servant, or a maid-servant, as is expressly
mentioned in Exod. xxi. 32; compare the remarks on Zech. xi. 12. And this opinion
is confirmed by the use of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;</span>. The ears
of a servant who was bound to his master to <i>perpetual</i> obedience, were bored;
compare Exod. xxxi. 5, 6; Deut. xv. 17, where it is added: &quot;And also unto thy maid-servant
thou shalt do likewise.&quot; In conformity with the custom of omitting the special members
of the body, in expressions frequently occurring, it is said simply &quot;to bore.&quot; The
meaning then is: I made her my slave. It was not a free woman, then, whom the prophet
desired in marriage, but a servant, whom he was obliged, previous to marriage, to
redeem from servitude; who was therefore under a double obligation to him, and over
whom he had a double claim. The reference to the thing to be typified is quite apparent.
It was not a free, independent people whom the Lord chose, but a people whom He
was obliged first to redeem from vile servitude, before He entered into a nearer
relation to them. This redemption appears, throughout, as a ransoming from the house
of bondage,&mdash;and the wonderful dealings of the Lord, as the price which He paid.
Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Deut. vii. 8: &quot;But because the Lord loved you, and because
He kept His oath which He had sworn to your fathers, He has brought you out with
a mighty hand, and redeemed thee (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1498;</span>) from
the house of bondmen (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span>), from the
hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.&quot; See also Deut. ix. 26. It is upon this redemption
that the exhortation to the people is founded&mdash;that, as the Lord&#39;s servants, they
should serve Him alone; comp., <i>e.g.</i>, the introduction to the Decalogue. Thus,
we have here also a feature so evidently typical, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>
so plainly transferred from the thing typified to the type, that we cannot any longer
think of an outward transaction. This argument, however, is, in the main point,
quite independent of the philological interpretation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;</span>. Even if it be translated &quot;I bought her
to me,&quot; the circumstance, notwithstanding, always remains, that the wife was redeemed
from slavery, unless there be a denial of the connection of the sum mentioned with
Exod. xxi. 32, and Zech. xi. 12, where the thirty pieces of silver likewise appear
as the estimate of a servant&#39;s value; and this circumstance evidently suggests the
inward character of the transaction.</p>
<p class="normal">The first germs of the representation of God&#39;s relation to Israel
under the figure of marriage, are found so early as in the Pentateuch, Exod. xxxiv.
15, 16; Lev. xx. 5, 6, xvii. 7; Num. xiv. 33&mdash;where idolatry, and apostasy from the
Lord in general, are represented as whoredom&mdash;Deut. xxxii. 16, 21; compare the author&#39;s
<i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pent.</i> vol. i. p. 107 ff.; and commentary
on the Song of Solomon, S. 261. But it was only through the Song of Solomon that
it became quite a common thing to represent the higher love under the figure of
the lower. It is not through accident that this representation appears so prominent
just in Hosea, where it not only pervades the first three chapters, but returns
continually in the second part also. Hosea, being one of the oldest prophets, was
specially called to fit, as a new link, into the Song of Solomon, which was the
last link in the chain of Sacred Literature. There are, moreover, in the details,
other undeniable references to the Song of Solomon, which coincide with this connection
with it, as regards the fundamental idea. The basis, however, for this whole figurative
representation is Gen. ii. 24, where marriage appears as the most intimate of all
earthly relations of love, and must, for this very reason, have a character of absolute
exclusiveness.</p>

<h3><a name="div3_197" href="#div3Ref_197">CHAP. I.-II. 3 (II. 1).</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The section chap. i.-iii. is distinguished from the other prophecies
by this,&mdash;that, in it, the relation of the Lord to the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
198]</span> people of Israel Is represented, <i>throughout</i>, under the figure
and symbol of marriage, whilst this same mode of representation is soon relinquished
wherever else it occurs in the book. By this closer limitation, the objections of
<i>Böckel</i> and <i>Stuck</i> to the common division of the collection into two
parts, are set aside. This first portion may be divided into three parts, which
are, in one respect, closely connected, as is shown by the <i>Fut.</i> with the
<i>Vav Conv.</i> in iii. 1, and likewise by the fact that this chapter requires
to be supplemented from the two preceding ones, while, in another respect, they
may be considered as wholes, complete in themselves. They do not, by any means,
so distribute the contents among themselves, as that the first describes the apostasy;
the second, the punishment; and the third, the return and restoration; but each
of them contains all these three features, and yet in such a manner, that here the
one feature, and there the other, is more fully expanded; so that the whole description
is complete, only when all the three parts are taken together. In the portion now
before us, the covenant relation into which the Lord entered with Israel is typified
by a marriage which the prophet contracted at the command of the Lord; the apostasy
of the people, and especially of the ten tribes, to whom the prophet was sent in
the first instance, is typified by the adultery of the wife, by the divine punishment,
and the unpropitious names which he gives to the children born by the adulterous
wife. In chap. ii. 1-3, there follows the announcement of salvation more directly,
and only with a simple allusion to the symbol.</p>

fact, that the whole of the following sentence is treated as one substantive idea:
the beginning &quot;of the Lord hath spoken,&quot; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span> etc.,
for &quot;the beginning of speaking.&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>,

&quot;and then He spoke,&quot; carries forward the discourse, as if there had preceded: the
Lord began to speak to Hosea. There is here a <i>constructio ad sensum</i>. It is
intentionally, and in order the more distinctly to point out the idea of the beginning,
that the prophet has made use of the noun <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;</span>,
not of the verb. The construction of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</span> with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>, with the signification &quot;to speak to some
one,&quot; may be explained thus:&mdash;that the words are, as it were, put into the mind of
the hearer in order that they may remain there. Several interpreters erroneously
translate, &quot;spoke through:&quot; others, following <i>Jerome</i> (the last is <i>Simson</i>),
&quot;spoke in;&quot; as if thereby the act of speaking were to be designated as an inward
one. The difference between outward and inward speaking disappears in the vision;
and, for this reason, we cannot imagine that there is any intention of here noticing
it particularly. Everything which takes place in the vision is substantially, indeed,
internal, but in point of form it is external. Moreover,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>
several times occurs in other passages also, where the signification, &quot;to speak
to some one,&quot; is alone admissible. Thus 1 Sam. xxv. 39, where <i>Simson&#39;s</i> explanation,
&quot;David sent and <i>ordered</i> to speak <i>about</i> Abigail,&quot; is set aside by ver.
40. The analogy of the construction of the verbs of hearing and seeing with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> is likewise in favour of our explanation.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_199a" href="#ftn_199a">[1]</a></sup>&mdash;A
wife of <i>whoredoms</i> and <i>children of whoredoms</i>. The wife belongs to whoredoms
in so far as she is <i>devoted to them</i>; the children, in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span> so far as they <i>proceed</i> from them. For
we cannot suppose that the children themselves are described as given to whoredom.
Such a thought would here be altogether out of place. For whoredom is here only
the general designation of adultery, as, by way of applying it to the case in question,
it is immediately subjoined, &quot;away from Jehovah.&quot; The subject of consideration is
only the relation of the wife and children to the prophet, as the type of the Lord;
and with this view, it is only the origin of the children from an adulterous wife
which can be of importance. That this alone is regarded, appears from ii. 6 (4),
compared with ver. 7 (5). That the children, as children of whoredoms, deserve no
compassion, is founded upon the fact that their mother plays the harlot.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1514; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span> is stronger than
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;</span>; it expresses the idea that the woman
is given, soul and body, to whoredoms. The same emphasis is expressed also by the
analogous designations: man of blood, of deceit, etc.&mdash;Calvin says, &quot;She is called
a wife of whoredoms, because she was long accustomed to them, gave herself over
to the lusts of all indiscriminately, did not prostitute herself once, or twice,
or to a few, but to the debauchery of every one.&quot; It is not without reason that
&quot;<i>take</i>&quot; is connected with the children also. The prophet shall, as it were,
receive and take, along with the wife, those who, without his agency, have been
born of her. It is self-evident, and has been, moreover, formerly proved, that we
cannot speak of children who were previously born of the prophet&#39;s wife; but that,
on the contrary, the children are they whose birth is narrated in ver. 4 seqq. And
that we cannot consider these children as children of the prophet, as is done by
several interpreters (<i>Drus.</i>: &quot;<i>Accipe uxorem et suscipe ex eâ liberos</i>&quot;),
is obvious from their being designated &quot;children of whoredoms;&quot; from the word &quot;take&quot;
itself, which is expressive of the passive conduct of the prophet; from the fact
that, in the subsequent verses, the conceiving and bearing of the wife are alone
constantly spoken of, but never, as in Is. viii. 3, the begetting by the prophet;
and, <i>finally</i>, from the relation of the type to the thing typified. By the
latter, it is absolutely required that children and mother stand in the same relation
of alienation from the legitimate husband and father. The words in ver. 3, &quot;She
bare him a son,&quot; are not indeed in opposition to it, for these words are only intended
to mark the deceit of the wife who <span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span> offers
to her husband the children begotten in adultery, as if they were his, and, at the
same time, to bring out the patience and forbearance of the husband who receives
them, and brings them up as if they were his, although he knows that they are not.
In like manner, the Lord treated, for centuries, the rebellious Israelites as if
they were His children, and granted to them the inheritance which was destined only
for the children, along with so many other blessings, until at length He declared
them to be bastards, by carrying them away into captivity. The last words state
the ground of the symbolical action. The causal <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span>
is explained from the fact that the import of a symbolical action is also its ground.
The <i>Inf. absol.</i> preceding the <i>tempus finitum</i> gives special emphasis
to the verbal idea. The prophet thereby indicates that, in using the expression
&quot;to whore,&quot; he does so deliberately, and because it corresponds exactly to the thing,
and wishes us to understand it in its full strength and compass. In calling the
thing by its right name, he silences, beforehand, every attempt at palliating and
extenuating it. Of such palliations and extenuations the Jews had abundance. They
had not the slightest notion that they had become unfaithful to their God, but considered
their intercourse with idols as trifling and allowable attentions which they paid
to them.&mdash;<i>Manger</i> understands by whoredoms, their placing, at the same time,
their confidence in man; but from what follows, where idolatry alone is constantly
spoken of, it is obvious that this is inadmissible. If this special thing be reduced
to its idea, it is true that trusting in men is, then, not less comprehended under
it than idolatry, inasmuch as this idea is the turning away from God to that which
is not God. And, from this dependence of what is special upon the idea, it follows
that the description has its eternal truth, and does not become antiquated, even
where the folly of gross idolatry has been long since perceived.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;</span>,
the definite land, the land of the prophet, the land of Israel.&mdash;Concerning the last
words, Ps. lxxiii. 27 may be compared, where <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;
&#1502;&#1503;</span> occurs with a similar signification. This phrase contains an allusion
to the common expression, &quot;to walk with, or after, God;&quot; compare 2 Kings xxiii.
3. According to <i>Calvin</i>, the spiritual chastity of the people of God consists
in their following the Lord.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And he went and took Gamer the daughter of Dibhlaim,
and she conceived and bare him a son.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span></p>
<p class="normal">Many interpreters suppose that, by the three children, three different
generations are designated, and the gradual degeneracy of the people, which sinks
deeper and deeper. But this opinion must certainly be rejected. There is no gradation
perceptible. On the contrary, the announcement of the total destruction of the kingdom
of Israel is connected immediately with the name of the first child, ver. 4. Nor
is it legitimate to say, as <i>Rückert</i> does, that the three children are a designation
of the &quot;conditions&quot; in which the Israelites would be placed in consequence of their
apostasy from the Lord. For, how could mercy be shown to <i>conditions</i>? The
right view rather is, that the wife and children are both the people of Israel,
viewed only in different relations. In the first designation, they are viewed as
a unity; in the latter, as a plurality proceeding from, and depending upon, this
unity. The circumstance that the prophet mentions the birth of children at all,
and the birth of three only, is accounted for by their names. The children exist
only that they may receive a name. The three names must, therefore, not be considered
separately, but must be viewed together. In that case they present a corresponding
picture of the fate impending upon Israel. The circumstance that the mother and
sons are distinguished in Hosea, rests upon the Song of Solomon. (Compare the more
copious remarks in my commentary on the Song of Sol. iii. 4: &quot;By the mother, the
people is designated according to its historical continuity,&mdash;by the daughter or
sons, according to its existence at any moment.&quot;)</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel;
for yet a little</i> (while), <i>and I visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house
of Jehu, and cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The name &quot;Jezreel&quot; is, by most expositors, explained in this passage
as meaning: &quot;God disperses.&quot; This they maintain to be its real signification, according
to the etymology, and that all the rest is only an allusion. But this exposition
is erroneous, as <i>Manger</i> has correctly perceived. For, 1. No instance occurs
where the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;</span> has this signification.
When applied to men, it is always used only in a good sense: compare ii. 25, Ezek.
xxxvi. 9, and the subsequent remarks on Zech. x. 9. The idea of <i>scattering</i>
is not at all the fundamental one; so that the signification, to <i>disperse</i>,
is much further from the fundamental <span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span> signification
than might, at first sight, appear. 2. The subsequent words must be considered as
an explanation of the name Jezreel, as is obvious from the corresponding explanations
of the names Lo-Ruhamah in ver. 6, and Lo-Ammi in ver. 9, which are intimately connected
with these names. But in this explanation, not even a single word is said on the
subject of the dispersion of the people of Israel. The circumstance that, in this
explanation, Jezreel occurs as a proper name, without any regard being paid to its
appellative signification<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_203a" href="#ftn_203a">[2]</a></sup>&mdash;an
allusion to which occurs only in the announcement of the salvation&mdash;shows that here
too it must be viewed in the same way. The correct view is this. Jezreel was the
place where the last great judgment of God upon the kingdom of Israel had been executed.
The apostasy from the Lord, and the innocent blood of His servants, shed by Jezebel
and the whole house of Ahab, had been there avenged upon them by Jehu, the founder
of the dynasty which was reigning at the time of the prophet. At the command of
God, Jehu is anointed as king by one of the sons of the prophets sent by Elisha,
2 Kings ix. In vers. 6-9 the Lord says to him through the latter: &quot;I anoint thee
king over the people of the Lord, over Israel. And thou shalt smite the house of
Ahab thy master; and <i>I avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the
blood of all the servants of the Lord at the hand of Jezebel, and the whole house
of Ahab shall perish.</i> And I give the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.&quot; The execution
corresponded with the command. When Jehu approached Jezreel, Joram the son of Ahab
went out against him, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite, ver.
21. Appealing to the declaration of the Lord, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
&quot;Surely I have seen the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, and I will requite
thee in this portion of ground&quot; (ver. 26), Jehu orders the corpse of the slain king
to be cast thither. At Jezreel, Jezebel too found a disgraceful death. Thither,
as to the central point of vengeance, were sent the heads of the seventy royal princes,
who had been slain, x. 1-10, and there Jehu slew all that remained of the house
of Ahab, ver. 11.&mdash;The royal house, and, along with it, all Israel, are now anew
to become a Jezreel; <i>i.e.</i>, the same divine punitive justice which, at that
time, was manifested at Jezreel, is to be exhibited anew. The reason why this should
be, is stated in the explanation. The house of Jehu, and all Israel, shall become
a Jezreel, in as far as punishment is concerned, because they have become a Jezreel
with respect to guilt, and because, as in former times at Jezreel, so now again,
blood that has been shed cries to the Lord for vengeance. Where a new carcase is,
there the eagles must anew be gathered together.&mdash;It must have, already appeared
from this, how we understand the words, &quot;I visit the blood of Jezreel,&quot; used in
the explanation of the name of Jezreel, in the verse under consideration. According
to the prophet&#39;s custom of designating, by the name of an old thing, any new thing
which is substantially similar to it, the new guilt is marked by the name of the
old; and it is marked as <i>blood</i>, because the former guilt was pre-eminently
blood-guiltiness;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_204a" href="#ftn_204a">[3]</a></sup>
and as the blood of Jezreel, because the former blood-guiltiness had been especially
contracted there, and it was there where the punishment was executed. The deep impression,
which just this mode of representation must have produced, must not be overlooked.
The sins formerly committed at Jezreel were acknowledged as such by the whole people,
and especially by the royal house, whose whole rights were based upon this acknowledgment.
The recollection of the fearful punishment was still in the minds of all; but they
did not by any means imagine that they were implicated in the same guilt, and had
to expect the same punishment. That which they considered as already
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span> absolutely past, the prophet, by a single
word, brings again into the present, and the immediate future. By a single word
of dreadful sound he terrified and aroused them out of their self-deception (which
will not recognise its own sin in the picture of the sins of others), and out of
their carnal security. Entirely analogous are 2 Kings ix. 31, where Jezebel says
to Jehu, &quot;Hast thou peace, Zimri, murderer of his master?&quot; which <i>Schmid</i> well
explains by&mdash;&quot;It is time for thee to desist, that thou mayest not experience the
same punishment as Zimri;&quot; Zech. v. 11, where the prophet mentions Shinar as the
place of Israel&#39;s future banishment; and x. 11, where he calls their future oppressors
by the names of Asshur and Egypt, and describes a new passing through the Red Sea.
In Revelation, the degenerate church is called by the names of Sodom and Egypt (xi.
18); the true Church, by Jerusalem; Rome, by Babylon.&mdash;The explanation which we have
given will be its own defence against the current, and evidently erroneous, expositions.
Many interpreters understand, by the blood of Jezreel, the slaughter of the family
of Ahab which was accomplished there by Jehu. It is, indeed, quite correct to say
that a deed objectively good does not thereby become one which is subjectively so.
That which has been willed and commanded by God may itself become an object of divine
punishment, if it be not performed from love and obedience to God, but from culpable
selfishness. But that Jehu was actuated by motives so bad, is sufficiently obvious
from the circumstance, that he himself did the very thing which he had punished
in the house of Ahab. <i>Calvin</i> rightly remarks: &quot;That slaughter is, as far
as God is concerned, a just vengeance; but, as far as Jehu is concerned, it is open
murder.&quot; But yet, this deed cannot be regarded as the principal crime of Jehu and
his family. We must not overlook other crimes far more heinous, and consider the
guilty blood shed by them as the sole ground of their punishment. That this was
indeed considered as guilt, but only as a lower degree of it, is clearly seen from
1 Kings xvi. 7, where destruction is announced to Baasha, who had destroyed the
house of Jeroboam I., &quot;on account of all the evil which he did in the sight of the
Lord, in provoking Him to anger with the works of his hands, so that he may be like
the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed him.&quot; The main crime is, that Baasha
had become like the house of Jeroboam. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span> What
he perpetrated against this house is the minor crime, and becomes a crime only through
the former.&mdash;It is worthy of notice that &quot;the blood of Jezreel&quot; exactly corresponds,
according to our explanation, with the expression, &quot;so that he may be like the house
of Jeroboam.&quot; It may be further noticed, that, in the deed of Jehu, every better
feeling cannot be excluded. If the command of God had been used by him merely as
a pretext, we could not account for the praise and the promises given to him on
account of this very deed, 2 Kings x. 30. It is true that the limitation of the
promise shows that pure motives alone did not prevail with him.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_206a" href="#ftn_206a">[4]</a></sup>&mdash;&quot;The
bloody deed to which the house of Jehu owed its elevation&quot; nowhere else appears
as the cause of the catastrophe which befell this house. That which he had done
against the house of Ahab, whose sins were crying to heaven for vengeance far more
than those of Baasha, is, in 2 Kings x. 30, 31, represented as his <i>merit</i>.
His <i>guilt</i> consisted in his not departing from the ways of Jeroboam, and in
his making Israel to sin. It is this guilt alone which, in the Book of Kings, is
charged against all the members of his family,&mdash;against Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu,
in 2 Kings xiii. 2; against Jehoash, in 2 Kings xiii. 11; against Jeroboam, in 2
Kings xiv. 24; against Zechariah, under whom the catastrophe took place, in 2 Kings
xv. 9: &quot;And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had
done, and departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made
Israel to sin.&quot; According to the context, we must, in the first place, think of
the <i>religious guilt</i>; the blood of Jezreel, in the verse under consideration,
must correspond with the <i>whoredoms</i> in ver. 2.&mdash;Moreover, the extension of
the punishment to all Israel could not, according to this explanation, be understood;
for the deed was only that of Jehu and his assistants. How, then, could not only
the house of Jehu be punished, but also <span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span> the
kingdom of the house of Israel be destroyed, and its bow broken in the valley of
Jezreel?</p>
<p class="normal">According to another interpretation still more prevalent, &quot;the
blood of Jezreel&quot; denotes &quot;all the evil deeds committed by the Israelitish kings
in Jezreel.&quot; But this interpretation is sufficiently invalidated by the single circumstance,
that the residence of the family of Jehu, which, after all, alone comes into consideration
in this place, was, from the very beginning, not Jezreel, but Samaria; compare 2
Kings x. 36, xiii. 10, xiv. 23.</p>
<p class="normal">Two particulars are contained in the announcement of punishment.
<i>First</i>,&mdash;The whole house of Jehu, and <i>then</i> all Israel, are to become
a Jezreel as regards punishment, as they are even now in point of guilt; and, in
this announcement, the significant <i>paronomasia</i> must not be overlooked between
<i>Israel</i>&mdash;the designation of the dignity of the people, and <i>Jezreel</i>&mdash;that
which is base in deeds and condition. Calvin makes prominent the last-mentioned
feature only: &quot;You are,&quot; he explains, &quot;a degenerate people, you differ in nothing
from your king Ahab.&quot; We cannot, however, follow him in this explanation; the words,
&quot;I cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel,&quot; cannot, as several interpreters
suppose, mean merely, &quot;I will put an end to the dominion of the family of Jehu over
Israel.&quot; That these words rather announce the cessation of every native regal government,
and hence of the entire national independence, is so evident, that it stands in
need of no proof. Both of these features are, in their fulfilment, separated indeed
by a long period of time (see the Introduction); but they are nevertheless closely
connected. With the ruin of the house of Jehu, the strength of the kingdom of Israel
was broken; from that time it was only a living corpse. The fall of the house of
Jehu was the beginning of the end,&mdash;the commencement of the process of putrefaction.
The omission, in the inscription, of all mention of any of the kings after Jeroboam,
coincides with the circumstance that the fall of the house of Jehu is connected
with the fall of the kingdom. With regard, however, to the former event, Hosea had
an earlier prophecy before him. It had been prophesied to Jehu (2 Kings x. 30) that
his children should sit on the throne until the fourth generation. Now, since Jeroboam
was the great-grandson of Jehu, the glory of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
this family must come to an end with his son. But at no period did the house of
Jehu, and the kingdom of Israel, seem to be so far from destruction as under the
reign of Jeroboam; and, hence, it was time that the forgotten prophecy should be
revived, and, at the same time, expanded.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I break
the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Of this, Calvin gives the following paraphrase: &quot;Ye are puffed
up with pride; ye oppose your fierceness to God, because ye excel in weapons and
strength; because ye are warlike men, ye believe that God can do nothing against
you. But surely your bows shall not prevent His hands from destroying you.&quot;&mdash;In the
valley of Jezreel, Israel shall become, as to punishment, what they already are,
as to guilt, viz., a &quot;Jezreel.&quot; The verse is a further expansion of the last words
of the preceding one, to which the words, &quot;at that day,&quot; refer. He whose bow is
broken is defenceless and powerless; compare Gen. xlix. 24; 1 Sam. ii. 4; Jer. xlix.
35. It is evident that we can here think only of the defeat of Israel by the Assyrians,
the consequence of which was the total overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. But it
is not to be overlooked, that the Assyrians, who in the second section of Hosea
are frequently mentioned in express terms, as the instruments of God&#39;s punishment,
are not spoken of at all as such in the first section, which belongs to the reign
of Jeroboam. Amos likewise abstains from mentioning any name of the enemies. The
Assyrians had not at that time appeared on the historical horizon. But the prophecy
was to evince itself as such, by the fact of the announcement of the judgment at
a time when its instruments were not as yet prepared; just as Elijah, in 1 Kings
xviii. 41, hears the rushing of the rain before there was even a cloud in the sky.&mdash;We
are not told in the historical books at what place Israel was defeated by the Assyrians.
<i>Jerome</i>, in his remarks on our passage, says that it took place in the valley
of Jezreel. It is very probable, however, that this is only an inference clothed
in the garb of history. But even apart from the passage under review, the matter
is very probable. The valley of Jezreel or Esdrelon &quot;is the largest, and at the
same time the most fertile, plain of Palestine. The brook of Kishon, which is, next
to Jordan, the most important river of Palestine, waters and fructifies it, and,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span> with its tributaries, flows through it in
all directions.&quot; (<i>Ritter</i>, S. 689.) In all the wars which were carried on
within the territories of the ten tribes, especially when the enemies came from
the North, it was the natural battle-field. &quot;It was, in the first centuries, the
station of a legion (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#8051;&#947;&#945; &#960;&#949;&#948;&#8055;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>);
it is the place where the troops of Nebuchadnezzar, Vespasian, Justinian, the Sultan
Saladdin, and many other conquering armies were encamped, down to the unsuccessful
expedition of <i>Buonaparte</i>, whose success in Syria here terminated. <i>Clarke</i>
found erected here the tents of the troops of the Pacha of Damascus. In later times,
it was the scene of the skirmishes between the parties of hostile hordes of Arabs
and Turkish pachas. In the political relations of Asia Minor, it is to this locality
that there must be ascribed the total devastation and depopulation of Galilee, which
once was so flourishing, full of towns, and thickly populated.&quot; (<i>Ritter</i>,
<i>Erdk.</i> 1 <i>Ausg.</i> ii. S. 387.) We may add, that, in the same plain also,
the battle was fought in which Saul and Jonathan perished (for the plain of Esdrelon
is bounded on the south-east by the mountains of Gilboa), and so likewise was the
battle between Ahab and the Syrians. To it also belonged the plain near the town
of Megiddo, where Josiah, in the battle against Pharaoh-Necho, was mortally wounded.
Compare <i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Alt.</i> ii. 1, p. 149.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And
He said to him, Call her name Lo-Ruhamah</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, one who has not obtained
mercy): <i>for I will not continue any more to have mercy upon the house of Israel;
for I will take away from them.</i>&quot;&mdash;Interpreters ask why the second child was a
female; and this question is by no means an idle one, since the prophet everywhere
else adheres closely to the subject-matter, and adds no feature, merely for the
sake of giving vividness to the picture. We cannot for a moment suppose, as <i>Jerome</i>
and others do, that the female child denotes a more degraded generation. For why,
then, is the third again a male child? The supposition proceeds from the altogether
unfounded notion that the three children denote different generations. The reason
must, on the contrary, be sought for in the name. <i>Schmid</i> says: &quot;It seems
to have reference to the weakness of the sex. For the female sex
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span> finds greater sympathy than the male.&quot; The
verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1495;&#1501;</span> does not denote any kind of love,
but only the love of him who is high to him who is low, of the strong to the weak;
and hence the LXX., whom Peter follows in 1 Pet. ii. 10 (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;
&#7968;&#955;&#949;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</span>), render the word more accurately than Paul, in Rom. ix. 25 (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;
&#7968;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</span>). Hence it is never used of man&#39;s love to God, but only of the
love of God to man,&mdash;of His mercy. The only passage which seems to contradict this,
Ps. xviii. 2, is not to the purpose, as, there, the <i>Kal</i> is used. But the
female sex, being weaker, stands in greater need of the compassion of men, than
does the male. Is. ix. 16. The female child places the neediness and helplessness
of the people in more striking contrast with the refusal of help from Him who alone
can bestow it. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;</span> is either <i>Participle</i>
in <i>Pual</i> which has cast off the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;</span>, or
the 3d fem. <i>Pret. in pause</i>; thus <i>Cocceius</i>, who explains it by: &quot;She
has not obtained mercy.&quot; It is in favour of the latter view, that according to
<i>Ewald</i>, § 310 b, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1488;</span> does not often stand
before a <i>Participle</i>. The words, &quot;<i>I will not continue</i>,&quot; refer to the
former great manifestations of divine mercy, and especially the last under Jeroboam,
which the people still, at that time, enjoyed; compare 2 Kings xiii. 23: &quot;And the
Lord was gracious unto them, and had <i>mercy</i> upon them, and turned towards
them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy
them, neither cast them from His presence.&quot; Upon this contrast, also, rests the
mild expression, &quot;I will not have mercy,&quot;&mdash;an expression which, in virtue of this
contrast, becomes stronger than any other. Several interpreters here lay peculiar
stress upon the circumstance, that &quot;the <i>house</i> of Israel&quot; is spoken of. This,
the kingdom of Israel, they say, as an independent state, is given over to everlasting
destruction; it is only single individuals who shall obtain mercy after they have
joined the house of David. But the supposition that &quot;house of Israel&quot; is used in
this sense, is altogether unfounded. The house is equivalent to the family; and
the prophets speak of &quot;a house of Israel&quot; after the destruction, no less than before
it. The words in ii. 6 (4), &quot;I will not have mercy upon her children,&quot; and the circumstance
that she who is here called Lo-Ruhamah is afterwards called Ruhamah, also militate
against referring &quot;house of Israel&quot; to the state. The right view rather is, that
the denial of mercy <span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span> must not be understood
absolutely, but relatively. It is not for ever that mercy shall be denied to them,
but for a time,&mdash;until God&#39;s punitive justice shall have been satisfied. Just as
Israel shall not always remain Jezreel, Lo-Ammi shall, at some future time, become
again Ammi.&mdash;The last words are, by the greater number of recent interpreters, almost
unanimously explained: &quot;That I should forgive them.&quot; But, in that case, we can perceive
no reason why the <i>Inf. abs.</i> should be placed before the <i>tempus finitum</i>.
Why should the verbal idea here be rendered so emphatic? In addition to this, the
extreme feebleness of the sense would be remarkable. Nothing would be said that
would not be already implied in the words, &quot;I will not continue any more to have
mercy.&quot; But, on the other hand, we obtain a very suitable sense if we translate
thus: &quot;I will take away from them.&quot; The object is not mentioned, just because <i>
every thing</i> is to be understood. The prominence given to the verbal idea is
then accounted for from its being contrasted with the <i>having mercy</i>, which
implies <i>giving</i>. There is then, moreover, a very striking contrast with the
standing phrase <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;</span>, or also simply
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1488; &#1500;</span>: I shall take away from them, not, however,
as hitherto, their guilt (compare Amos vii. 8), but all that they have. <i>Calvin</i>
had previously directed attention to the circumstance that the following verse also
is in favour of the translation by <i>tollere</i>: &quot;<i>Servare et tollere inter
se opponit propheta.</i>&quot; Chap. v. 14 may also be compared, where
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1488;</span> is used in a similar manner, the object
being likewise omitted: &quot;I will tear and go away, I will take away, and there is
none that delivereth.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 7. &quot;<i>And I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and
I save them by the Lord their God; and I do not save them by bow, and by sword,
and by war, and by horses, and by horsemen.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Several interpreters suppose that mercy is here promised to Judah
as a <i>consolation</i> to Israel, inasmuch as the latter should partake in it.
But this view is erroneous. From the antithesis to ver. 6, it is evident that mercy
is here promised to Judah for the time when Israel shall not find mercy; and we
are not at liberty to anticipate the time described in ii. 1-3, when both become
partakers of mercy. This is apparent also from the circumstance that in vers. 8,
9, the threatening of punishment <span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span> to Israel
is still continued. It can then only be the intention of the prophet, by describing
the mercy which Judah their brethren should experience, to sharpen the goad, more
effectually to rouse Israel from their false security, and to direct their attention
to the bad foundation of the entire constitution of their political and ecclesiastical
affairs, in consequence of which they considered as legitimate that which, in Judah,
was only an abuse. As the showing of mercy to Judah runs parallel with the withholding
of it from Israel, we can, primarily and chiefly, think only of the different fates
of the two, during the Assyrian dominion. The wonderful deliverance of Judah on
that occasion is foretold by Isaiah, xxxi. 8, in a similar manner: &quot;And Asshur falls
through the sword not of a man, and the sword not of a man devours him.&quot; We must
not, however, limit ourselves to this event; a preference of Judah over Israel,
a remnant of divine mercy appeared, even when they were carried away into captivity.
During its continuance, they were not altogether deprived of marks of the continuance
of the divine election. Prophets continued to labour among them, as immediate ambassadors
of God. Wonderful events showed them in the midst of the Gentiles the superiority
of their God, and prepared the way for their deliverance. They maintained, in a
far greater degree, their national constitution; and, <i>lastly</i>, their affliction
lasted for a far shorter time than did that of the Israelites. Contrary to all human
expectation, their affairs soon took a favourable turn, in which only a comparatively
small number of their Israelitish brethren partook, while, for the rest, the withholding
of mercy continued. But it is just by means of this contrast with the lot of Judah,
that the announcement of the lot of Israel appears in its true light. Without this
contrast, one might have imagined, that the announcement of the prophet did not
go beyond his human vision. It would, of course, appear highly probable that a kingdom
so weak as that of Israel,&mdash;weak, especially when compared with those great Asiatic
kingdoms which were great already, and yet were continually striving after enlargement,&mdash;a
kingdom, moreover, placed in the midst between these kingdoms, and their natural
enemy and rival, Egypt&mdash;should not have been able to maintain its existence for any
length of time. But this probability existed in a far higher decree in the case
of the kingdom of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span> Judah, which was smaller
and weaker still, and which had suffered much through Jehoash the father of Jeroboam
(2 Kings xiv. 13), under the latter of whom, the splendour and glory of Israel had
been so greatly increased. But that which prevented this probability from becoming
a reality lay altogether beyond the sphere of human calculation, as Hosea himself
here so emphatically expresses. And by <i>such</i> help, the kingdom of Israel would
have been delivered, no less than the kingdom of Judah. It is true that this prediction
of Hosea is no prediction of some accidental event, but has its foundation in the
idea. The lots of Israel and Judah could not be otherwise than so different, after
their different position in reference to the Covenant-God was once fixed. Nor is
this prediction one which has ceased after its first and literal fulfilment, but
is constantly and anew realizing itself. The proceeding of God towards the different
Churches and States is regulated by their conduct towards Him. The history of the
world is a judgment of the world. But even to know this truth is, in itself, a supernatural
gift; and they only are able to use it with safety, to whom God has given an insight
into the mysteries of His government of the world. This becomes very evident, if
we observe how often the predictions of those who knew the truth in general, down
to <i>Bengel</i> and his followers, have been put to shame by the result. God&#39;s
ways are not our ways. No one knows them except Himself, and those to whom He will
reveal them. The extent to which the prophecy rests on the idea is, moreover, clearly
seen by the words, &quot;And I save them <i>by Jehovah their God</i>.&quot; Here we have the
ground of their deliverance. Jehovah is the God of Judah, and, hence, the source
of their salvation, which does not cease to flow although all human sources be dried
up. The reason why Israel does not obtain mercy must then be, that Jehovah is not
their God. That this contrast is implied here, is confirmed by iii. 5: &quot;Afterwards
shall the children of Israel return and seek the <i>Lord their God</i>, and David
their king.&quot; That which in aftertimes they shall seek, and thereby obtain salvation,
they must have lost now; and this loss must be the source of their affliction. Calvin
makes the following pertinent remark: &quot;The antithesis between the false gods and
Jehovah must here be kept in mind. Jehovah was the God of the house of Judah; and
hence, it is just as if the prophet had said, &#39;Ye <span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>
indeed profess the name of God, but ye worship the devil, and not God. Ye have no
part in Jehovah. He resides in His temple, and has pledged His faithfulness to David
when He commanded him to build Him a temple on Mount Zion; but from you, the true
God has departed!&#39;&quot; (Compare Amos ii. 8, where the prophet speaks of the god of
the ten tribes as one who belongs to them alone, and with whom he has nothing to
do.) In contrast with Him who alone could grant help, and whom Israel did not possess,
but Judah did, the prophet enumerates, in the remaining part of the verse under
consideration, the aids which could not afford any real help, in which Israel was,
at that time, much richer than Judah, and in which they placed a false confidence.
Compare x. 13: &quot;Thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men;&quot;
Ps. xx. 8; Mic. v. 9 seqq.; and Deut. xxxiii. 29, where the Lord is spoken of as
the only true bulwark and armour: &quot;Happy art thou, Israel: who is like unto thee?
a people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, thy proud sword: thine enemies
shall be liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places.&quot; Calvin says,
&quot;God does not require any other aids; His own strength is quite sufficient. The
sum and substance is therefore this, that although the weakness of the kingdom of
Judah excites the contempt of all, this shall be no obstacle to its deliverance
by the grace of God, although there be no help at all from men.&quot;&mdash;The prophet has,
at the same time, before his eyes the great events of former history, where, when
all human resources failed, the power of God had shown itself to be alone quite
sufficient.&mdash;We cannot assert with <i>Gesenius</i>, that &quot;war&quot; should here be quite
identical with &quot;weapons of war;&quot; it rather comprehends everything which is required
for war, viz., the prudence of the commanders, the valour of the heroes, the strength
of the army, etc. &quot;Heroes and horsemen&quot; are, however, specially mentioned, because
in ancient times the main strength of the armies lay in these. Even Mahommed thought
himself entitled to hold up a victory which he had obtained without cavalry&mdash;by infantry
alone&mdash;as a miracle wrought immediately by God; comp. <i>Abulf. vit. Moh.</i> pp.
72, 91.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 8. &quot;<i>And she weaned Lo-Ruhamah, and conceived, and bare
a son.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 9. &quot;<i>And He said, Call his name, Lo-Ammi</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span> my people); <i>for you are not My people,
and I, not will I be yours.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">As the prophet everywhere else adheres closely to his
subject-matter, as, indeed, he allows the figure to recede behind the subject of
his discourse, but never the opposite, we cannot well imagine that the weaning is
mentioned merely for the purpose of making the description more graphic. Calvin
says, &quot;I do not doubt that the prophet intends here to commend the Lord&#39;s long-continued
mercy and forbearance towards that people.&quot; The unfaithfulness of the wife, and
the forbearance of the prophet, do indeed continue for years. But it is better to
suppose that the mention of the weaning is intended to separate the territory of
Lo-Ruhamah from the following birth, and to call forth the idea that, now, there
may follow one of better import.&mdash;The literal translation of the close of the verse
is, &quot;And I will not be to you&quot;&mdash;equivalent to, &quot;I will not any longer belong to you.&quot;
We cannot assume, as <i>Manger</i> does, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</span>
has been here left out, nor, as others do, that it must be supplied. Since it is
God who speaks, &quot;to you,&quot; or &quot;yours,&quot; is sufficiently definite. Similar is Ezek.
xvi. 8: &quot;And I entered into a covenant with thee, and thou becamest Mine,&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;</span>; Ps. cxviii. 6: &quot;The Lord is mine,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1497;</span>, I will not fear.&quot; The explanation
given by some, &quot;I shall not be among you,&quot; is too limited. It is the highest happiness
to possess God Himself, with all His gifts and blessings, and the greatest misery
to lose Him. The fulfilment of this threatening is reported in 2 Kings xvii. 18:
&quot;And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of His sight; and
there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone;&quot; comp. also Is. vii.</p>
<p class="normal">The first three verses of the following chapter ought to have
been connected with the first chapter; for they contain the announcement of salvation
which is necessary to complete the first prophecy.</p>
<p class="normal">Chap. ii. 1. &quot;<i>And the number of the children of Israel shall
be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured nor numbered. And it shall come
to pass, in the place where it was said unto them, Not my people ye, it shall be
said unto them. Sons of the living God.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal" dir="ltr">The first point which requires to be determined, is
the subject of the verse. Every other reference except that to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span> ten tribes is here out of the question; inasmuch
as the same who, in the preceding verse, were called Lo-Ammi, are now to be called
sons of the living God. Several of the ancient expositors here assume a sudden transition
to the Christian Church; but such would be a <i>salto mortale</i>. Nor are we to
understand by the children of Israel, all the descendants of Jacob; for the children
of Judah are distinguished from them in ver. 2. Substantially, however, those too
are included, as appears from this very verse; for both shall then form one nation
of brethren. But here the prophet views only one portion, because to this only did
the preceding threatening, and the mission of the prophet in general, refer. From
this, also, it may be explained how the prophet may apply to the <i>part</i> the
promises of Genesis, which there refer to the <i>whole</i>. The reference to these
promises, in the first part of the verse, cannot be at all mistaken. Compare especially,
as agreeing most literally, the passage in Gen. xxii. 17: &quot;I will multiply thy seed
as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on the shore of the sea;&quot; and xxxii.
13 (12): &quot;I make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered for multitude.&quot;
A similar literal reference is in Jer. xxxiii. 22: &quot;As the host of heaven is not
numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David
My servant.&quot; Now, the reference here cannot be accidental. It supposes that these
promises were at that time generally known in the kingdom of Israel. They served
to strengthen the ungodly in their false security. Relying on them, they charged
the prophets with making God a liar in thus announcing the impending destruction
of the kingdom, inasmuch as the prophecy had not yet been fulfilled in all its extent.
The prophet, however, by his almost literal repetition of the promise, shows that
thereby his threatenings are not excluded&mdash;&quot;teaches that the visitation of which
he had spoken would be such that, nevertheless, God would not forget His word; that
the rejection of the people would be such that, nevertheless, its election should
stand firm and sure,&mdash;and, finally, that the adoption should not be invalid by which
He had chosen Abraham&#39;s progeny as His people&quot; (<i>Calvin</i>).&mdash;The case is quite
analogous, when corrupted Christian churches harden themselves in trusting in the
promise that the Lord would be with them all the days, and that the gates of hell
should not prevail against His Church. The <span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
Lord knoweth how to execute His judgments so that His promises shall not suffer
thereby, yea, that their fulfilment is thereby rendered possible. The relation of
our passage to Is. x. 22 requires <i>further</i> to be considered: &quot;For though thy
people Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant only shall return.&quot; Here, too,
the reference to the promises in Genesis cannot be mistaken. But there is this difference,&mdash;that
in the time of Isaiah, the people, viewing the partial fulfilment of the promises
of God in their then prosperous condition, as a sure pledge of divine mercy, founded
thereupon their false security. To this, however, the prophet replies, that even
the perfect fulfilment would give no warrant for it. In Hosea, however, they rely
on the perfect fulfilment, which had, as yet, no existence at all. But Hosea has
in view the godly as much as the ungodly. To the former he shows that here also
there would be a fulfilment of what is written in Num. xxiii. 19: &quot;God is not a
man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent. Should He
say, and not do it; and speak, and not fulfil it?&quot; Moreover, we cannot fail to see
that, in the verse under review, as also in ver. 2, there is an allusion to the
first child, Jezreel,&mdash;that in the second member of the verse there is an allusion
to Lo-Ammi, and in ver. 3, to Lo-Ruhamah. But the name Jezreel is now taken in a
good sense, probably in the sense in which it was first given to the valley (compare
remarks on i. 4), and also to the town by its founders. Jezreel means &quot;God sows.&quot;
The founders of the town thereby expressed the hope that God would cause an abundant
harvest to proceed from a small sowing&mdash;a glorious end from a small beginning. Thus
God will now sow the small seed of Israel, and an infinitely rich harvest shall
be gained from this sowing; compare remarks on ver. 25.&mdash;But if now we seek for the
historical reference of the announcement, we are compelled to go back to the sense
of those declarations in Genesis. By many, these are referred merely to the bodily
descendants of the Patriarchs; by many, also, to their spiritual descendants, their
successors in the faith. But the latter reference is altogether arbitrary; and the
former could be well-founded only, if the Congregation of the Lord had been destined
solely for the natural descendants, and if all the Gentiles had been refused admittance
into it. But that such is not the case, is evident from the command to circumcise
every bondservant; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span> for, by circumcision, a
man was received among the people of God. This appears, <i>further</i>, from the
command in Exod. xii. 48, that every stranger who wished to partake of the Passover
must be previously circumcised; and this implies that strangers might partake in
the sign and feast of the covenant if they wished; compare <i>Michaelis</i>, <i>
Mos. Recht.</i> Th. iv. § 184. This appears, <i>moreover</i>, from Deut. xxiii.
1-8, where the Edomites and Egyptians are expressly declared to be capable of being
received into the Congregation of the Lord. It appears, <i>still further</i>, from
the circumstance that, in the same passage, the command to exclude the Ammonites
and Moabites is founded upon a special reason. And, <i>finally</i>, it appears from
the Jewish practice at all times. But the heathens who were received among the people
of God were considered as belonging to the posterity of the Patriarchs, as their
sons by adoption. How indeed could it be otherwise, since, by intermarriage, every
difference must have very soon disappeared? They were called children of Israel,
and children of Jacob, no less than were the others. It now appears to what extent
the promise to the Patriarchs refers to the Gentiles also&mdash;viz., in so far as they
became believers in the God of Israel, and joined themselves to Israel. Compare
Is. xliv. 5: &quot;One shall say, I am Jehovah&#39;s, and another shall call the name of
Jacob, and another shall write with his hand. Unto the Lord! and boast of the name
of Israel.&quot; Such an eager desire of the Gentiles towards the kingdom of God regularly
took place, either when the God of Israel had revealed Himself by specially distinguishing
manifestations of His omnipotence and glory, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the deliverance
from the Egyptian and Babylonish captivities, in both of which events we find a
number of those who had previously been heathens, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;</span>, in the train of the Israelites;&mdash;or when a feeling of the vanity of the
idols of the heathen world had been awakened with special vividness, as in the times
after Alexander the Great, in which Roman and Greek heathenism became more and more
<i>effete</i>, and rapidly hastened on towards ruin. In the time of Christ, both
of these causes co-operated. If there were soundness in the opinion now generally
prevalent, according to which the Church of the New Testament stands quite independent
of the Congregation of Israel, having originated from a free and equal union of
believers from Israel, and of those from among the Gentiles,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span> then indeed the promise now before us would
have no longer any reference to New Testament times. The New Testament Church would
be a generation altogether different, and no longer acknowledge Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob as their fathers. But, according to the constant doctrine of the Old as
well as of the New Testament, there is only one Church of God from Abraham to the
end of the days&mdash;only one house under two dispensations. John the Baptist proceeds
upon the supposition that the members of the New Testament also must be children
of Abraham, else the covenant and promise of God would come to nought. But as the
bodily descent from Abraham is no security against the danger of exclusion from
his posterity&mdash;of which Ishmael was the first example&mdash;and as, so early as in the
Pentateuch, it is said, with reference to every greater transgression, &quot;This soul
is cut off from its people,&quot; so, on the other hand, God, in the exercise of His
sovereign liberty, may give to Abraham, in the room of his degenerate children after
the flesh, adopted children without number, who shall sit down with him, and Isaac,
and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, whilst the sons of the kingdom are cast out.&mdash;After
these remarks on the promise to the Patriarchs, there can be no longer any difficulty
in making out the historical reference of the announcement before us. It cannot
refer to the bodily descendants of Abraham, as such, any more than the promise of
a son to Abraham was fulfilled in the birth of Ishmael, or than the Arabs stand
related to the promise of the innumerable multitude of his descendants,&mdash;a promise
which is repeated, in the same extent, to Isaac and Jacob, although they were not
the ancestors of the Arabs. Degenerate sons are not a blessing; they are no objects
of promise, no sons in the full sense. Every one is a son of Abraham, only in so
far as he is a son of God. For this reason the phrases &quot;sons of Israel&quot; and &quot;sons
of the living God&quot; are, in the passage before us, connected with each other. Not
as though the corporeal descent were altogether a matter of indifference. The corporeal
descendants of the Patriarchs had the nearest claims to becoming their children
in the full sense. It was to them that the means of becoming so were first granted.
To them pertained the covenants, the promises, and the adoption, Rom. ix. 4. But
all these external advantages were of no avail to them when they allowed them to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span> remain unused; in these circumstances, neither
the promise to Abraham, nor the announcement before us, had any reference to them.
Both of them would have remained to this day unfulfilled, although the unconverted
children of Israel had increased so as to have become the most populous nation on
the face of the whole earth. It thus appears that the announcement before us was
first truly realized in the time of the Messiah; inasmuch as it was at that time
that the family of the Patriarchs was so mightily increased; and that it will yet
be more fully realized, partly by the reception of an innumerable multitude of adopted
sons, and partly by the elevation of those who were sons only in a lower sense,
to be sons in the highest. That which occurred at the time after the Babylonish
captivity, when the Lord stirred up a number of Israelites to return to Palestine,
we can regard as only an insignificant prelude; partly because this number was too
small to correspond, even in any degree, to the infinite extent of the promise,
and partly because there were among them certainly a few only who, in the fullest
sense, deserved the name of &quot;Children of Israel.&quot; &quot;Israel&quot;&mdash;which is the higher name,
and has reference to the relation to God&mdash;is here used emphatically, as appears especially
from a comparison with ver. 4, where it is taken from the degenerate children, and
exchanged for the name &quot;Jezreel.&quot;&mdash;In the second part of the verse, we must first
set aside the false interpretation of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;</span>
by &quot;instead of,&quot; which is given by <i>Grotius</i> and others. It has arisen from
an inappropriate reference to the Latin, which has, however, no support in the Hebrew
<i>usus loquendi</i>. The words can only mean (compare Lev. iv. 24, 33; Jer. xxii.
12; Ezek. xxi. 35; Neh. iv. 14): &quot;in the place where,&quot; or, more literally still,
&quot;in the place that&quot;&mdash;the wider designation instead of the narrower. The <i>status
constr.</i> is explained by the circumstance that the whole succeeding sentence
together expresses only one substantive idea, equivalent to: &quot;in the place of the
being said unto them.&quot; The place may here be, either that where the people first
received the name Lo-Ammi, <i>i.e.</i>, Palestine, or the place of the exile, where
they first felt the full meaning of it,&mdash;the misery being a <i>sermo realis</i> of
God. Decisive in favour of the latter reference is the following verse, where the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span>, the land of the exile, corresponds with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;</span> in the verse before us. (According to
<i>Jonathan</i>, the sense is: &quot;In the place to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>
which they have been carried away among the Gentiles.&quot;) It is intentionally that
both times the Future <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;</span> is used, which
is to be understood as the Present. The difference of time being thus disregarded,
the contrast becomes so much the more striking.&mdash;By &quot;people&quot; and &quot;children&quot; of God,
the same thing is expressed according to different relations. The Israelites were
the people of God, inasmuch as He was their King; and children of God, in as far
as He was their Father,&mdash;their Father, it is true, in the first place, not, as in
the New Testament (John i. 12, 13), in reference to the spiritual generation, but
in relation to heart-felt love, similar to the love of a father for a son. With
regard to the Old Testament idea of son ship to God, compare the remarks on Ps.
ii. 7. In this relation, sometimes all Israel is personified as the son of God;
thus, <i>e.g.</i>, Exod. iv. 22: &quot;Thus thou shalt say unto Pharaoh: My son. My first-born
is Israel.&quot; Sometimes the Israelites are also called the <i>children</i> or <i>sons</i>
of God; <i>e.g.</i>, Deut. xiv. 1: &quot;Ye are children to the Lord your God&quot; (compare
also Deut. xxxii. 19), although not every single individual could on this account
be called &quot;son of God.&quot; In this sense, that designation is never used, evidently
because the sonship under the Old Testament does not rest so much on the personal
relation of the single individual to God,&mdash;as is the case in the New Testament,&mdash;but
the individual rather partakes in it only as a part of the whole. But there is an
easy transition from the sonship as viewed in the Old Testament, to the sonship
as seen in the New. The former, in its highest perfection, cannot exist at all without
the latter. It is only when its single members are born of God, that the Congregation
can be regarded and treated as the child of God in the full sense of the word, and
that the whole fulness of His love can be poured out upon it; for this is the only
way of attaining to likeness with God, which is the condition of admission to the
rights of children. Hence it appears that the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#8055;&#945;</span>
under the Old Testament was an actual prophecy of the times of the New Testament;
and from it, it follows also that the announcement under consideration has its ultimate
reference to these times. Earlier fulfilments&mdash;especially at the return from the
Babylonish captivity&mdash;are not to be excluded, inasmuch as the idea comprehends in
it everything in which it is, even in the least degree, realized; but they can be
considered <span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span> only as a slight prelude to Its
real fulfilment, which takes place only when the reality fully coincides with the
idea; so that we are not at liberty to limit ourselves to the commencement of the
Messianic time, but must include the Messianic time in its last consummation.&mdash;Another
question still remains:&mdash;Why is God here called the &quot;<i>living</i>?&quot; Plainly, to
point out the antithesis of the true God to dead idols, which cannot love, because
they do not live; and thus to bring out the greatness of the privilege of being
the child of such a God. The same antithesis is found in Deut. xxxii. 3 seqq.: &quot;Where
are now their gods, the rock in whom they trusted, which did eat the fat of their
sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? Let them rise up and help
you; let it be a covering to you. See now that I, I am He, and not is a God beside
Me. I kill and I make alive. I wound and I heal.&quot; This antithesis still continues;
the world has only changed its idols. It still always seeks the life from the dead,
from the gross idol of sin up to the refined idol of a self-made abstract god, whether
he be formed from logical notions or from emotions and feelings. But how much soever
they may strive to give life to their idols, they remain dead, although they should
even attain to a semblance of life. The true God, on the contrary, lives and continues
to live, how much soever they may strive to slay Him. He manifests Himself as the
living one, either by smiting and killing them, if they continue in their impenitence,
or by healing and quickening them, if they become His children.&mdash;<i>Finally</i>,&mdash;we
must still consider the two citations, in the New Testament, of the passage before
us. One in 1 Pet. ii. 10, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#8050; &#959;&#8016; &#955;&#945;&#8056;&#962;, &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#948;&#8050;
&#955;&#945;&#8056;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166;&#903; &#959;&#7985; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7968;&#955;&#949;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;, &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#951;&#952;&#8051;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>, must certainly strike us,
inasmuch as this epistle, on conclusive grounds (compare <i>Steiger</i> S. 14 ff.),
cannot be considered as being addressed to Jewish Christians exclusively. But still
more striking is the second quotation in Rom. ix. 25, 26:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#8041;&#963;&#951;&#8050; &#955;&#8051;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#903; &#922;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#969; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#955;&#945;&#8057;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#965;, &#8051;&#957;
&#956;&#959;&#965;&#903; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7968;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;&#957;, &#7968;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;&#957;. &#922;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#964;&#8057;&#960;&#8179; &#959;&#8023; &#7952;&#8164;&#8165;&#8053;&#952;&#951; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;
&#959;&#8016; &#955;&#945;&#8057;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965; &#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#954;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8054; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;.</span> Here our passage is
not only alluded to, but expressly quoted, and, in opposition to the Jews, the calling
of the Gentiles is proved from it. But how can a passage which, according to the
whole context, can refer to Israel only, be applied <span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>
directly to the Gentiles? The answer very readily suggests itself when we reduce
the prophecy to its fundamental idea. This is none other than that of divine mercy,
which may indeed, by apostasy and unfaithfulness, be prevented from manifesting
itself, but can never be extinguished, because it has its foundation in God&#39;s nature.
Compare Jer. xxxi. 20: &quot;Is Ephraim a dear son to Me, a child of joy? For as often
as I speak of him, I must still remember him. Therefore My bowels sound for him,
<i>I will have mercy</i> upon him, saith the Lord.&quot; Now, in the same manner as this
truth was realized in the restoration of the children of Israel to be again the
children of God, so it is in the reception of the Gentiles. It is not at all a mere
application, but a real proof which here forms the question at issue. It is <i>because</i>
God had promised to receive again the children of Israel, that He must receive the
Gentiles also; for otherwise that divine decree would have its foundation in mere
caprice, which cannot be conceived to have any existence in God. Although the Gentiles
are not so near as Israel, yet He must satisfy the claims of those who are more
remote, just because He acknowledges the claims of those who are near. The necessity
of going back to the fundamental idea appears in the promises as well as in the
commandments. We cite only one instance which is especially fitted to serve as a
parallel to the case before us. There is no doubt, and prejudice alone could have
denied, that in the Pentateuch, by <i>friend</i> and <i>brother</i> the Israelite
is to be understood throughout; it is in the New Testament that the command of Christian
brotherly love is given. After having commended truthfulness, Paul adds: &quot;Because
ye are members of one another&quot;&mdash;a reason which can refer to those only who have Christ
as their common head. From this limitation, can anything be inferred to the prejudice
of love towards the whole human race, or of the duties towards all without any distinction?
Just the reverse. It is just because the Israelite is bound to love the Israelite,
and the Christian the Christian, that he should embrace all men in love. If the
special relation to God as the common Redeemer afford the foundation for the <i>
special</i> love, then the <i>general</i> relation to God as the Creator and Preserver
must also afford the foundation of <i>universal</i> love; just as from the command
to honour father and mother, it necessarily follows that we must also
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span> honour uncle and aunt, king and magistrate.
This is the only correct view of the laws and prophecies; and if it be consistently
followed out, it will make water to flow out of the rock, and will create streams
in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>And the children of Judah and the children of Israel
assemble themselves together, and set over themselves one head, and go up out of
the land; for great is the day of Jezreel.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;They appoint themselves a king,&quot; appear strange at
first sight. For it is not, in general, the union of Judah and Israel which the
prophet expects from better times;&mdash;a <i>perverse</i> union of both, one, it may
be, in which the house of Judah shall also give up Jehovah his God, and David his
King, only in order to be able to live on a right brotherly footing with Israel,
would have been anything but a progress and a blessing;&mdash;but such a union as has
for its foundation the return of Israel to the true God, and to the Davidic dynasty.
This appears clearly from iii. 5. The difficulty is removed by a comparison with
the passage of the Pentateuch to which the prophet seems to allude: &quot;Thou shalt
set over thee a king, whom the Lord thy God shall choose,&quot; Deut. xvii. 15. The prophet
seems to have these words before his eyes, as it appears elsewhere also, where he
describes the hitherto opposite conduct of the Israelites; compare the remarks on
iii. 4. From these it appears that the election of the king by God, who had promised
eternal dominion to the house of David, and his election by the people, do not in
the least exclude one another. On the contrary, it is <i>because</i> God had elected
the king, that now the people also elect him. <i>Calvin</i> remarks: &quot;There appears
to be transferred to men what properly belongs to God alone&mdash;viz., the appointment
of a king; but the prophet expresses, by this word, the obedience of faith; for
it is not enough that Christ be given, and placed before men as a King, but they
must also acknowledge and reverently receive Him as a King. From this we infer,
that when we believe the Gospel, we choose, as it were by our own vote, Christ as
our King.&quot; That the prophet understands the &quot;setting of a head&quot; in this sense, appears
also from the circumstance that the whole verse is based upon the reference to the
Exodus from Egypt, which is now to be repeated. To this the words, &quot;They assemble
themselves together,&quot; likewise refer; for the departure from Egypt was preceded
by the assembling together of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span> whole people.
The mention of a &quot;head&quot; refers back to Moses. In his case, as well as that of David
subsequently, the election by the people was only the acknowledgment of his having
been divinely called.&mdash;Another question is, How are the words, &quot;They go up out of
the land,&quot; to be understood? There can be no doubt that by &quot;land,&quot; the land of captivity
is designated. For the words are borrowed from Exod. i. 10, where Pharaoh says,
&quot;When there falleth out any war, they will join our enemies, and fight against us,
and go up out of the land,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span>.
The prophet, moreover, is his own interpreter in ii. 17, where he expressly compares
this new going up to the promised land with the former going up from Egypt: &quot;<i>As
in the day when she went up out of the land of Egypt</i>;&quot; just as, in other passages,
he describes their being carried away, under the figure of their being carried away
to Egypt&mdash;Assyria being considered as another Egypt. Compare viii. 13: &quot;Now will
He remember their iniquity and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt;&quot; ix.
3: &quot;They shall not dwell in the Lord&#39;s land, and Ephraim returns to Egypt.&quot; (Compare,
on this passage, the Author&#39;s <i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,
vol. i. p. 121 ff.) Moreover, in the other prophets also, the going up from, or
deliverance out of, Egypt, forms throughout the basis of the second great deliverance.
And this is quite natural; for both of those events stand in the closest actual
connection with each other;&mdash;both proceeded from the same Divine Being; and the former
was a prophecy <i>by fact</i>, and a pledge of the latter. The deliverance of the
people of God from Egypt sealed their election; and from the latter the new deliverance
necessarily followed;&mdash;a relation which repeats itself in individuals also. From
this we may explain the fact that in the Psalms, they who celebrate God&#39;s former
mercies, prove from them to Him and to themselves, throughout, that He must now
also be their helper. It is then by no means a mere external similarity which induces
the prophets ever and anon to refer to the deliverance from Egypt (compare the passages
Mic. ii. 12, 13; Jer. xxiii. 7, 8, which bear so close a resemblance to the passage
before us), any more than that the Passover is a mere memorial. Such cannot occur
in the true religion which has a living God, and hence knows nothing of anything
absolutely past. <i>Ewald&#39;s</i> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span> exposition,
that they go up out of the country for the purpose of further conquest, and that
of <i>Simson</i>, that they go up to Jerusalem, sever the three events which, as
the example of previous history shows, are evidently so closely allied; and these
expositors, moreover, give, by an addition of their own, that definiteness to the
words, &quot;And they shall go up out of the land,&quot; which they can obtain only by a reference
to the history of the past. In their ambiguity, they almost expressly point to such
a commentary.&mdash;The article in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span>, <i>the</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, the definite) land, is explained from the circumstance that, in the
previous context, there had been an indirect allusion to their being carried away
into a strange land. If Israel was no more the people of God,&mdash;if they no longer
enjoyed His mercy, then it is supposed that they could not remain in the land which
they had received only as the people of God, and had hitherto retained only through
His mercy. But, primarily, the article refers to &quot;the place where it was said unto
them,&quot; in the preceding verse.&mdash;That along with the children of Israel, the children
of Judah also assemble themselves and go up, implies a fact which the prophet had
not expressly mentioned, because it did not stand immediately connected with his
purpose&mdash;viz., that Judah too should be carried into captivity. It thus supplements
chap. i. 7, by showing that the mercy there promised to the inhabitants of Judah
is to be understood relatively only. Such suppositions, indeed, show very plainly
how distinctly the future lay before the eyes of the prophet.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_226a" href="#ftn_226a">[5]</a></sup>&mdash;With
regard, now, to the historical reference,&mdash;it must, in the first place, be remarked,
that whatever is here determined concerning it, must be applicable to all other
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span> parallel passages also, in which a future
reunion of Israel and Judah, and their common return to the promised land, are announced;
<i>e.g.</i>, Jer. iii. 18: &quot;In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the
house of Israel, and they come together out of the land of the north to the land
that I have given to their fathers;&quot; l. 4: &quot;In those days the children of Israel
shall come, they and the children of Judah together, weeping shall they come and
seek the Lord their God.&quot; Compare also Is. xi.; Ezek. xxxvii. 19, 20. In the passage
under consideration, several interpreters, as <i>Theodoret</i>, think of the return
from Babylon, and refer the &quot;one head&quot; to Zerubbabel. Now we certainly cannot deny
that, in that event, there is a small beginning of the fulfilment. But if that had
been the entire fulfilment, Hosea would more resemble a dreamer and an enthusiast
than a true prophet of the living God. The objection which immediately presents
itself&mdash;viz., that, after all, the greatest portion of the ten tribes, and a very
considerable part of Judah, remained in captivity&mdash;is by no means the strongest.
Although the whole both of Judah and Israel had returned, the real and final fulfilment
could not be sought for in that event. It is not the renewed possession of the country,
as such, which the prophet promises, but rather a certain kind of possession,&mdash;such
a possession as that the land is completely the land of God, partaking in all the
fulness of His blessings, and thus a worthy residence for the people of God, and
for their children. One may be in Canaan, and yet, at the same time, in Babylon
or in Assyria. Had not the threatened punishment of God been indeed as fully executed
upon those who, during the Assyrian and Babylonish captivities, wandered about the
country in sorrow and misery, as upon those who were carried away? Can the circumstance
that Jews are even now living in Jerusalem in the deepest misery, be adduced as
a proof that the loss of the promised land, with which the people were threatened,
had not been completely fulfilled? It is true that, during the times of the Old
Covenant, there existed a certain connection betwixt the lower and the higher kinds
of possession. As soon as the people ceased to be the people of the Lord, they lost
with the former, after being often previously warned by the decrease of it, the
latter also. As soon as they obtained again the lower kind of possession, which
could happen only in the case of a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span> return
to the Lord, they recovered, to a certain degree, in proportion to the earnestness
and sincerity of their conversion, the higher kind of possession also. A commencement
of the fulfilment must, therefore, be at all events assumed in the return from the
Babylonish captivity; but a very feeble commencement only. Just as the conversion
was very superficial, so was the degree of the higher kind of possession but a very
small one. The manifestations of mercy were very sparing; the condition of the new
colony was, upon the whole, very poor; they did not possess the land as a free property,
but only under the dominion of a foreigner. That which was, in one respect, the
termination of the captivity, was, in another, much rather a continuation of it.
It was certainly not the true Canaan which they possessed, any more than one still
possesses the beloved object while he embraces only his corpse. Where the Lord is
not present with His gifts and blessings, there Canaan cannot be. It was just as
the land of the presence of the Lord, that it was so dear and valuable to all believers.&mdash;From
what has now been said, it appears that, as regards the historical reference, we
need not limit ourselves to the times of the Old Covenant, nor dream of a return
of Israel to Canaan to take place at some future time. Luther&#39;s explanation, &quot;They
will go up from this place of pilgrimage to the heavenly father-land,&quot; is quite
correct,&mdash;not indeed according to the letter, but according to the spirit. It is
not the form, but the essence of the divine inheritance, which the prophet has in
view. The form is a different one under the New Covenant, where the whole earth
has become a Canaan; but the essence remains. To cling here to the form, would be
just as absurd as if one, who, for Christ&#39;s sake, has forsaken all, were to upbraid
Him because he had not received again, according to the letter of His promise, precisely
an hundred-fold, lands, brothers, sisters, mothers, etc., Mark x. 30. The words
of God, which are spirit and life, must be understood with spirit and life.&mdash;Suppose
that the children of Israel were, at some future time, to return to Canaan, this
would have nothing to do with our prophecy. In a religious point of view, it would
be a matter of no consequence, and could not serve to prove the covenant-faithfulness
of God. Under the New Covenant it finds its fulfilment, that &quot;Canaan must, even
in the North, bloom joyfully around the beloved.&quot; The three stations<span class="pagenum">
[Pg 229]</span>&mdash;Egypt, the wilderness, and Canaan&mdash;will continue to exist for ever;
but we go from the one to the other only with the feet of the spirit, and not, as
in the Old Covenant, with the feet of the body at the same time. The grossly literal
explanation which knows not to separate the thought from its drapery, the essential
from the accidental, agrees, just in the main point, with the allegorical explanation&mdash;viz.,
in interpolating, instead of interpreting.&mdash;The fulfilment of the prophecy before
us is, therefore, a continuous and progressive one, which will not cease until God&#39;s
whole plan of salvation be consummated. It began at Babylon, and was carried forward
at the appearance of Christ, whom many out of Judah and Israel set over themselves
as their head, to be their common leader to Canaan. It is, even now, realized every
day before our eyes in every Israelite who follows their example. It will, at some
future time, find its final fulfilment in the last and greatest manifestation of
God&#39;s covenant-faithfulness towards Israel, which, happily, is as strongly guaranteed
by the New as it is by the Old Testament.&mdash;The last words of the verse have been
already explained, substantially, in ver. 1. The name &quot;Jezreel&quot; is here used with
a reference to its appellative signification. Israel appears here (compare ver.
25 [23], which serves as a commentary and as a refutation of differing interpretations)
as a seed which is sown by God in fruitful land, and which shall produce a rich
harvest. The figure appears, with a somewhat different turn, in Jer. xxxi. 27; Ezek.
xxxvi. 9, where the house of Israel, and the house of Judah, appear as the soil
in which the seed is sown by God. Analogous is also Ps. lxxii. 16: &quot;They of the
city shall flourish up like the grass of the earth.&quot;&mdash;The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> is explained by the circumstance that the
sowing, which can take place only in the land of the Lord (compare ver. 25), supposes
the going up from the land of the captivity. But if the day of sowing be great,
if it be regarded by God as high and important, then the going up, which is the
condition of sowing, must necessarily take place.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>Say ye unto your brethren, My people</i> (Ammi);
<i>and to your sisters, Who has obtained mercy</i> (Ruhamah).&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;My people,&quot; are a concise expression for: &quot;You whom
the Lord has called. My people.&quot; The mention of the brothers and sisters is explained
by the reference to the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span> male and female members
of the prophet&#39;s family. The phrase, &quot;Say ye,&quot; is in substance equivalent to: &quot;Then
will ye be able to say.&quot; The prophet sees before him the people of the Lord who
have experienced mercy; and calls upon the members to salute one another joyfully
with the new name given to them by God. Such is the simple meaning of the verse,
which has been darkened by a multitude of forced interpretations.</p>

	would be rather strange to translate &quot;in me.&quot; There is nothing else to lead
	us to conceive that the apparition of angels in Zech. is internal. But Num.

<p class="normal">&quot;The significant couple&quot;&mdash;<i>Rückert</i> remarks&mdash;&quot;disappears in
the thing signified by it; Israel itself appears as the wife of whoredoms.&quot; This
is the only essential difference between this and the preceding sections; and it
is the less marked, because even there, in the last part of it, the symbolical action
passed over into a mere figure. With this exception, this section also contains
the alternation of punishment and threatening, and of promise,&mdash;the latter beginning
with ver. 16 (14). The features of the image, which were less attended to in the
preceding portion, but are here more carefully portrayed, are the rejection of the
unfaithful wife, and her gradual restoration. <i>Calvin</i> says: &quot;After God has
laid open their sins before men. He adds some consolation, and tempers the severity,
lest they should despair. But then He returns again to threatenings, and He must
do so necessarily; for though men may have been terrified by the fear of punishment,
yet they do not recover, and become wise for ever.&quot; &quot;By a new impetus as it were,&quot;
says <i>Manger</i>, &quot;he suddenly returns to expand the same argument, and sets out
again from things more sad.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not
my wife, and I am not her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face,
and her adultery from her breasts.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Calvin</i> is of opinion that a contrast is here intended,
inasmuch as the Israelites were striving with God, and attributed to Him the cause
of their misfortune: &quot;Do not contend with Me, but rather with your mother, who,
by her adultery, has brought down <i>righteous</i> punishment upon herself and upon
you.&quot; But this interpretation is inadmissible; because it proceeds
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span> from the unfounded supposition that the divorce
is to be considered as having already taken place outwardly, whilst the contending
here clearly appears as one by which divorce may yet be averted. The words, &quot;Contend
with your mother,&quot; rather mean, on the contrary, that it is high time to call her
to account, if they would not go to destruction along with her. From this, however,
we are not entitled to infer that the moral condition of the children was better
than that of the mother. Without any regard to their moral condition, the prophet
only wishes to say that their interest required them to do this. If it were not
his intention just to carry out the image of adultery, he might as well have called
upon the mother to contend against the children, as it is said in Is. li. 1: &quot;Behold,
for your iniquities you have been sold, and for your transgression your mother has
been put away.&quot; In point of fact, the mother has no standing-place apart from the
children. <i>Vitringa</i> says: &quot;One and the same people is called &#39;mother&#39; when
viewed in their collective character; and &#39;children&#39; when viewed in the individuals
who are born of that people. For a people is born from the people. For the whole
people is considered according to that which is radical in it, which constitutes
its nature and substance,&mdash;and, in this respect, it is called the &#39;mother of its
citizens.&#39;&quot; But we are as little entitled to infer from this exhortation, that a
reform, and an averting of the threatened judgments, may still be hoped for. This
is opposed by what follows, where the wife appears as incorrigible, and her rejection
as unavoidable. The fundamental thought is, on the contrary, only this:&mdash;that a reform
is necessary if the threatened judgments are to be averted. That this necessity,
however, would not become a reality, the prophet foresaw; and for this reason he
speaks unconditionally in the sequel. But from this again it must not be inferred
that, in that case, his exhortations and threatenings would be altogether in vain.
Though no reform was to be expected from the people, single individuals might, nevertheless,
be converted. At the same time, it was of great importance for the future, that
before the calamity should break in, a right view of it should be opened up to the
whole people. It is of great importance, that if any one be smitten, he should know
for what reason. The instructions in the doctrines of Christianity, which a criminal
has received in childhood, may <span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span> often seem
for a long series of years to have been altogether in vain; but afterwards, notwithstanding,
when punishment has softened his heart, they bring forth their fruits.&mdash;In the words,
&quot;For she is not my wife, and I am not her husband,&quot; the ground of the exhortation
is stated. Even for this reason, the words cannot be referred to the <i>external</i>
dissolution of the marriage, to the punishment of the wife; they signify rather
the <i>moral</i> dissolution of the marriage&mdash;the guilt of the wife&mdash;and are equivalent
to: &quot;our marriage is dissolved <i>de facto</i>.&quot; But in the case of the spiritual
marriage, this dissolution <i>de facto</i> is always, sooner or later, according
to the greater or smaller measure of God&#39;s forbearance, followed by the dissolution
<i>de jure</i>; or, to speak without figure, wherever there is sin, punishment will
always follow. God bears with much weakness on the part of His people; but wherever,
through this weakness, the relation to Him is essentially dissolved, He there annuls
the relation altogether. The <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962;</span>
applies to spiritual marriages also. The surrender of the main faculties and powers
of our nature to something which is not God, stands on a par with carnal adultery.
Thus, then, the connection betwixt &quot;contend&quot; and &quot;for&quot; clearly appears.&mdash;Many interpreters,
viewing the clause beginning with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> as parenthetical,
would connect the last words of the verse with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;</span>:
&quot;Contend with your mother that she may put away.&quot; But the words are rather to be
considered as parallel with the first member; for &quot;contend,&quot; etc., is equivalent
to: &quot;seek to bring your mother to a better way,&quot; or: &quot;let your mother reform herself.&quot;
Her crime is designated first as whoredom, and then as adultery. The relation in
which the two stand to one another is plainly seen from chap. i. 2, where the notion
of adultery is paraphrased by: &quot;whoring away from the Lord.&quot; By &quot;whoredom,&quot; the
<i>genus</i>&mdash;carnal crimes in general&mdash;is designated; by &quot;adultery,&quot; the <i>species</i>,
or carnal crime by which the sacred rights of another person are, at the same time,
violated. The idea of whoredom, when transferred to a spiritual relation, implies
chiefly the worldliness of those with whom God has not entered into any special
relation; whilst the idea of adultery implies the worldliness of individuals and
communities with whom God has entered into a special marriage, and whose apostasy
is, for this reason, far more culpable. Leaving out of <span class="pagenum">[Pg
233]</span> view the more aggravating circumstance, the prophet first speaks of
whoredom in the case of the children of Israel also.&mdash;The reason why the whoredom
is here attributed to the face, and the adultery to the breasts, is well given by
<i>Manger</i>: &quot;We need not have any difficulty about seeing adultery attributed
to the very face and breasts. There is a certain expressiveness in this conciseness
which demonstrates, as it were before our eyes, that, in her whole deportment, the
wife was given over to sensuality, and that her whole aim was only to excite to
it, and to practise it. For the face is, with women, the sign of dissolute lasciviousness&mdash;as
<i>Horace</i> expresses it in his Odes, I. 19:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="continue">Urit grata protervitas <br>
	Et vultus nimium lubricus aspici.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continue">Ezekiel, too, in chap. xxiii. 3, speaks of &#39;the pressed breasts
of Israel in Egypt.&#39;&quot; <i>Schmid</i> states as the reason why just the face and breasts
are mentioned, &quot;that Scripture, in order not to offend modesty, forbears to mention
the worse and grosser deeds of fornication.&quot; But this is very little in harmony
with the manner of Scripture&mdash;as may be seen from a comparison of Ezek. xvi. and
xxiii., and of ver. 12 of the chapter before us. The reason rather is, that those
parts are here specially to be mentioned, in which the whoring nature openly manifests
itself; so that the highest degree of impudence is thereby expressed. This then
shows that there is no longer any halting, no longer any struggle of the better
against the evil principle. Such an impudent whore he resembles who, without shame
or concern, publicly exhibits his devotedness to the world. In this way has <i>Calvin</i>
also explained it. &quot;There is no doubt,&quot; says he, &quot;that the prophet here expresses
the impudence of the people, who in their hardihood, in their contempt of God, in
their sinful superstitions, and in every kind of wickedness, had gone to such lengths,
that they were like whores who do not conceal their turpitude, but publicly prostitute
themselves, yea, try to exhibit the signs of their wickedness in their eyes, as
well as in their whole body.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>Lest I strip her naked and expose her as in the day
of her birth, and make her like the wilderness, and set her like dry land, and slay
her by thirst.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In the marriage here spoken of, there was this peculiarity, that
the husband first redeemed the wife from a condition the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
234]</span> most wretched and miserable, before he united himself to her; and hence
became her benefactor, before he became her husband. Compare iii. 2, where the Lord
redeems the wife from slavery; and Ezek. xvi. 4, where the people appear as a child
exposed, naked, and covered with filth, upon whom the Lord has mercy,&mdash;whom He provides
with precious clothing and splendid ornaments, and destines for His spouse. During
the marriage, the husband continues his liberality towards his wife. But now, the
gifts, all of which had been bestowed upon her only with a view to the marriage
which was to take place or was already entered upon, are to cease, because the marriage-tie
has been broken by her guilt. She now returns to the condition of the deepest misery
in which she had been sunk before her union to the Lord.&mdash;There is, in this, an allusion
to that which, in the case of actual marriage, the husband was bound to give to
his wife, viz., clothing and food; compare Is. iv. 1. If God withdraws His gifts,
the consequences are infinitely awful, because, altogether unlike the natural husband,
He has everything in His possession; if He does not give anything to drink. He then
slays by thirst. If we keep in view this aggravation of the punishment, which has
its ground only in the person of the husband, it is evident that we have here before
us only a reference to the withdrawal of the marriage-gifts which is the consequence
of the divorce, and not, as several interpreters&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Manger</i>&mdash;suppose,
to a punishment of adultery, alleged by them to have been common at that time, &quot;that
the wife was stripped of her clothes, exposed to public mockery, and killed by hunger
and thirst.&quot; The eternal and universal truth which, in the verse before us, is expressed
with a special reference to Israel, is, that all the gifts of God are bestowed upon
individuals, as well as upon whole nations, either in order to lead them to the
communion of life with Him, or because this communion already exists; just as our
Saviour says that to him who has successfully sought for the kingdom of heaven,
all other things shall be added, without any labour on his part. If we overlook
the truth that the gifts of God have this object&mdash;if they be not received and enjoyed
as the gifts of God&mdash;if the spiritual marriage be refused, or if, having been already
entered into, it be broken,&mdash;sooner or later the gifts will be withdrawn.&mdash;The word
&quot;naked&quot; properly includes a whole clause: &quot;I shall strip <span class="pagenum">[Pg
235]</span> her so that she shall become naked.&quot; The verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490;</span>, &quot;to place,&quot; &quot;to set,&quot; has the secondary
signification of public exhibition; compare Job xvii. 6. The literal translation
ought to be, &quot;I shall expose her as <i>the day</i> of her birth;&quot; and we must assume
that there is here the occurrence of one of those numerous cases, in which the comparison
is merely alluded to, without being carried out; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Like the
day of Midian,&quot; Is. ix. 3; &quot;Their heart rejoiceth like wine,&quot; Zech. x. 7. The <i>
tertium comparationis</i> between the day of her birth and her future condition
is only the entire nakedness; compare Job i. 21. Any allusion to the filth, etc.,
is less obvious; the prophet would have been required to give an intimation of this
in some manner. The two parts of the first hemistich of the verse correspond with
each other; just as do the three parts of the second hemistich. In the first, the
withdrawal of clothing, and nakedness; in the second, the withdrawal of food, and
hunger and thirst. It is questionable whether the mention of the birth-day here
belongs merely to the imagery, is a mere designation of entire nakedness, because
man is never more naked than when he comes into the world; or whether it is to be
understood as belonging to the thing itself, and refers to the condition of the
people in Egypt to which they are now to be reduced. In favour of the latter explanation,
there is not only the comparison of the parallel passage in Ezekiel, but, still
more, the purely matter-of-fact character of the entire description. Israel is,
in this section, not <i>compared</i> to a wife, so that <i>figure</i> and <i>thing</i>
would be co-ordinate, but appears as the wife herself. Ver. 17 also is in favour
of this interpretation.&mdash;The words, &quot;I make her like the wilderness,&quot; which, by
<i>Hitzig</i> and others, are erroneously referred to the country instead of the
people, are pertinently explained by <i>Manger</i>: &quot;The prophet depicts a horrible
and desperate condition, where everything necessary for sustaining life is awanting,&mdash;where
she has to endure a thirst peculiar to an altogether uncultivated and sunburnt wilderness.&quot;
The comparison appears so much the more suitable, when we remark that wilderness
and desert are here personified, and appear as hungry and thirsty. This, however,
was too poetical for several prosaic interpreters. Hence they would in both instances
supply a <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> after the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;</span>, &quot;as in the wilderness&quot; = &quot;I place her in
the condition in which she was formerly, in the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>
wilderness.&quot; But it is self-evident that such a supplying of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> is inadmissible. If we were to receive this
interpretation, we must rather assume that here also there is merely a comparison
intimated: &quot;as the wilderness,&quot;&mdash;for, &quot;as she was in the wilderness.&quot; But even then,
the interpretation cannot, for another reason, be admitted. The impending condition
of the people did not, in the least, correspond to what it was in the wilderness.
The natural condition of the wilderness was not then seen in all its reality; the
people of the Lord received bread from heaven, and water from the rock. It has its
antitype rather in such a condition as that which is to follow upon the punishment,
ver. 16. The Article indicates that, by &quot;the wilderness,&quot; we are here to understand,
specially, the Desert of Arabia,&mdash;the desert <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>.
But that this comes into consideration only as one especially desolate, and not
as the former abode of the Israelites, appears from the following&mdash;&quot;in dry land,&quot;
without the Article, and not, as otherwise we would expect, &quot;in <i>the</i> dry land.&quot;
<i>Finally</i>,&mdash;We have a parallel to this in the threatening in Deut. xxviii. 48:
&quot;And thou servest thine enemy whom the Lord thy God will send upon thee, in hunger,
and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in great want.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>And I will not have mercy upon her children, for they
are children of whoredoms.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It appears from ver. 7, that the children are to be repudiated
on account of their origin (compare the remarks on i. 2), and not on account of
their morals. <i>Michaelis</i> says, &quot;They have the same disposition, and follow
the same course as their adulterous mother; for a viper bringeth forth a viper,
and a bad raven lays a bad egg.&quot; The cause of their rejection is, that they are
children of whoredoms. That they are such, is proved by the circumstance that their
mother is whoring. Compare also v. 7: &quot;They have become faithless to the Lord, for
they have born strange children.&quot; In point of fact, however, a sinful origin and
a sinful nature are identical.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 7. &quot;<i>For their mother has been whoring, she who bore them
has been put to shame; for she has said, I will go after my lovers, the givers of
my bread and my water, of my wool and my flax, of my oil and my drink.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1492;</span> is explained in a
two-fold way. The common explanation is: &quot;She has practised what is disgraceful,
she has acted <span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span> shamefully.&quot; Others, on the
contrary, explain: &quot;She has been put to shame, she has been disgraced.&quot; In this
latter way it is explained by <i>Manger</i>, who remarks, &quot;that this word is stronger
than <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;</span>; that it implies not only an accusation
of vile whoredom, but also that she has been convicted of this crime, and as it
were apprehended <i>in flagranti</i>; so that, even if she were yet impudent enough,
she could no longer deny it, but must sink down in confusion and perplexity.&quot; This
latter exposition is, without doubt, the preferable one; for, 1.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;</span> never occurs in the first-mentioned
signification. <i>Winer</i> contents himself with quoting the passage before us.
<i>Gesenius</i> refers, moreover, to Prov. x. 5. But the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;</span> of that passage is evidently a son
bringing disgrace upon his parents,&mdash;in xxix. 15 <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;</span>
is added,&mdash;or making them ashamed, disappointing their hopes. On the other hand,
the signification, &quot;to be put to shame,&quot; &quot;to be convicted of a disgraceful deed,&quot;
is quite an established one. Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Jer. ii. 26: &quot;As the disgrace
of a thief when he is found, thus the whole house of Israel is <i>put to shame</i>;&quot;
Jer. vi. 15: &quot;They are put to shame, for they have committed abomination; they shamed
not themselves, they felt no shame;&quot; compare also Jer. viii. 9. In all these passages,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;</span> signifies the shame forced upon those
who have no sense of shame.&mdash;2. The signification, &quot;to act disgracefully,&quot; does not
admit of a regular grammatical derivation. <i>Gesenius</i> refers to analogies such
as <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; ,&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489;</span>; but these would be admissible
only if the <i>Kal</i> <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;</span> signified, &quot;to
be infamous,&quot; while it means only &quot;to be ashamed.&quot; Being derived from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;</span>, the verb can mean only &quot;to put to shame,&quot;
in which signification it occurs, <i>e.g.</i>, in 2. Sam. xix. 6. But, on the other
hand, the signification, &quot;to be put to shame,&quot; can be well defended. As the <i>Hiphil</i>
cannot have an intransitive signification, it must, with this signification, be
considered as derived from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1514;</span>, &quot;<i>pudorem,
ignominiam contraxit</i>,&quot;&mdash;a view which is favoured by Jer. ii. 26.&mdash;The &quot;lovers&quot;
are the idols; compare the remarks on Zech. xiii. 6. The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> confirms the statement, that she who bare
them has been whoring, and has been put to shame by a further exposure of the crime
and its origin. The same delusion which appears here as the cause of the spiritual
adultery, is stated as such also in Jer. xlix. 17, 18. Jeremiah there warns the
people not to contract sin by idolatry, because that was the cause of all their
present misery, and would bring upon them <span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>
greater misery still. But they answer him, that they would continue to offer incense
and drink-offerings to the Queen of heaven, as they and their fathers had formerly
done in their native land; for, &quot;since we left off to do so, we have wanted all
things, and were consumed by hunger and sword.&quot; The antithesis in Jer. ii. 13 of
the fountain of living waters, and the broken cisterns that hold no water, has reference
likewise to this delusion. But that which is the <i>cause</i> of the gross whoredom,
is the <i>consequence</i> of the refined one. The inward apostasy must already have
taken place, when one speaks as the wife does in the verse before us. As long as
man continues faithfully with God in communion of life, he perceives, by the eye
of faith, the hand in the clouds from which he receives everything, which guides
him, and upon which everything&mdash;even that which is apparently the most independent
and powerful&mdash;depends. As soon as, through unbelief, he has lost this communion with
God, and heaven is shut against him, he allows his eye to wander over every visible
object, looks out for everything in the world which appears to manifest independence
and superior power, makes this an object to which he shows his love, soliciting
its favour, and making it his god. In thus looking around, the Israelites would,
necessarily and chiefly, have their eyes attracted by the idols. For they saw the
neighbouring nations wealthy and powerful; and these nations themselves derived
their power and wealth from the idols. To these also the Israelites now ascribed
the gifts which they had hitherto received; and this so much the rather, because
it was easier to satisfy the demands of these idols, than those of the true God,
who requires just that which it is most difficult to give&mdash;the heart, and nothing
else. And, being determined not to give it to Him, they felt deeply that they could
expect no good from Him. Whatever good He had still left to them, they could consider
as only a gift of unmerited mercy, and destined to lead them to repentance,&mdash;a consideration
which makes a natural man recoil and draw back, inasmuch as, in his relation to
God, he always thinks only of merit. That which we thus perceive in them is even
now repeated daily. We need only put in the place of idols, the abstract God of
the Rationalists and Deists, man&#39;s own power, or the power of other men, and many
other things besides, and it will at once be seen that the words, &quot;I will go after
my lovers that give me my <span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span> bread,&quot; etc., are,
up to the present moment, the watch-word of the world.&mdash;&quot;Bread and water&quot; signify
the necessaries of life; &quot;oil and (strong) drink,&quot; those things which serve rather
for luxuries.&mdash;&quot;My bread,&quot; etc., is an expression of affection, indicating that she
regards these as most necessary, and to be sought after, in preference to everything
else.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 8. &quot;<i>Therefore, behold, I hedge up thy way with thorns,
and I wall her wall, and her paths she shall not find.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The apostate woman is first addressed: &quot;<i>thy</i> way;&quot; but the
discourse then passes to the third person,&mdash;&quot;her wall, her paths.&quot; We must not conceive
of this, as if the wife were to be shut up in a two-fold way:&mdash;first, by a hedge
of thorns, and then, by a wall; but the same thing is expressed here by a double
figure, as is also done in Is. v. 5. First, the shutting up is alone spoken of;
it is afterwards brought into connection with the effects to be thereby produced;
and because she is enclosed by a wall, she cannot find her path. &quot;I wall her wall&quot;
is tantamount to, &quot;I make a wall for her.&quot; The words of the husband in the verse
under consideration form an evident contrast to those of the wife in the preceding
verse. <i>Schmid</i> says: &quot;The punishment is by the law of retaliation. She had
said, &#39;I will go to my lovers;&#39; but God threatens, on the contrary, that He will
obstruct the way so that she cannot go.&quot;<!--See 1854 ed.--> The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;</span> points to the unexpectedness of the result.
The wife imagined that she would be able to carry out her purpose with great safety
and ease; it does not even occur to her to think of her husband, who had hitherto
allowed her, from weakness, as she imagines, to go on her way undisturbed; but she
sees herself <i>at once</i> firmly enclosed by a wall.&mdash;There can be no doubt, that,
by the hedging and walling about, severe sufferings are intended, by which the people
are encompassed, straitened, and hindered in every free movement. For sufferings
regularly appear as the specific against Israel&#39;s apostasy from their God. Compare,
<i>e.g.</i>, Deut. iv. 30: &quot;In the tribulation to thee, and when all these things
come upon thee, thou returnest in the end of the days to the Lord thy God, and hearest
His voice;&quot; Hosea v. 15: &quot;I will go and return to My place till they become guilty;
in the affliction to them, they will seek Me.&quot; The figure of enclosing has elsewhere
also, undeniably, the meaning of inflicting sufferings. Thus in Job iii. 23: &quot;To
the man whose way is hid, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span> and whom God has
hedged in round about;&quot; xix. 8: &quot;He hath fenced up my way and I cannot pass, and
upon my paths He sets darkness;&quot; Lam. iii. 7: &quot;He hath hedged me about, and I cannot
get out; He hath made my chain heavy;&quot; compare also ibid. ver. 9; Ps. lxxxviii.
9.&mdash;The object of the walling about is to cut her off from the lovers; the infliction
of heavy sufferings is to put an end to idolatrous tendencies.&mdash;The words, &quot;thy way,&quot;
clearly refer to, &quot;I will go after my lovers,&quot; in ver. 7; and by &quot;her paths which
she cannot find,&quot; her whole previous conduct in general is indeed to be understood,
but chiefly, from the connection with ver. 7, her former intercourse with idols.
But here the question arises:&mdash;How far is the remedy suited for the attainment of
this end? We can by no means think of an external obstacle. Outwardly, there was,
during the exile, and in the midst of idolatrous nations, a stronger temptation
to idolatry than they had in their native land. Hence, we can think of an internal
obstacle only; and then again we can think only of the absolute incapacity of the
idols to grant to the people consolation and relief in their sufferings. If this
incapacity has been first ascertained by experience, we begin to lose our confidence
in them, and seek help where alone it can be found. As early as in Deut. xxxii.
we are told how misery proves the nothingness of false gods, and shows that the
Lord alone is God; compare especially ver. 36 sqq. Jeremiah says in ii. 28, &quot;And
where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise and help thee in the
time of trouble.&quot; That which the gods cannot turn away, they cannot have sent; and
if the suffering be sent by the Lord, it is natural that help should be sought from
Him also. Compare vi. 1: &quot;Come and let us return unto the Lord, for He hath torn
and He healeth us, He smiteth and He bindeth us up.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 9. &quot;<i>And she runs after her lovers and shall not overtake,
and she seeks them and shall not find; then she saith: I will go and return to my
first husband, for it was better with me then than now.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;</span> has, in <i>Piel</i>,
not a transitive, but an intensive meaning. <i>Calvin</i> remarks: &quot;By the verb,
insane fervour is indicated, as indeed we see that idolaters are like madmen; it
shows that such is the perverseness of their hearts, that they will not at once
return to a sound mind.&quot; The distress at first only increases
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span> the zeal in idolatry; compare Jer. xliv. 17.
Every effort is made to move the idols to help. But if help be, notwithstanding,
refused&mdash;and how could it be otherwise, since they from whom it is sought are <i>
Elilim</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, nothings?&mdash;they by and by begin to bethink themselves, and
to recover their senses. They discover the nothingness of their idols, and return
to the true God. This apostasy and return are in a touching manner described by
our prophet in xiv. 2-4 also. The words, &quot;I will go and return to my first husband,&quot;
form a beautiful contrast to, &quot;I will go after my lovers,&quot; in ver. 7. This statement
of the result shows that God&#39;s mercy is then greatest and most effective, just when
it seems to have disappeared altogether, and when His punitive justice seems alone
to be in active exercise. For the latter is by no means to be excluded, inasmuch
as there is no suffering which does not, at the same time, proceed from it, and
no punishment which is inflicted solely on account of the reformation.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 10. &quot;<i>And she, she does not know that I gave her the corn,
and the must, and the oil, and silver I multiplied unto her, and gold which upon
Baal they spent.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The prophet, starting anew, here returns to a description of her
guilt and punishment; and it is only from ver. 16 that he expands what, in ver.
9, he had intimated concerning her conversion, and her obtaining mercy. The words,
&quot;She saith,&quot; in that verse, belong thus to a period more remote than the words,
&quot;She does not know,&quot; in the verse before us. The things which are here enumerated
were, in the case of Israel, in a peculiar sense, the gift of God. He bestowed them
upon the Congregation as her Covenant-God, as her husband. They are thus announced
as early as in the Pentateuch; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Deut. vii. 13: &quot;And He loveth
thee, and blesseth thee, and multiplieth thee, and blesseth the fruit of thy womb,
and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, thy must, and thy oil;&quot; xi. 14: &quot;And I give
the rain of your land in due season, and thou gatherest in thy corn, thy must, and
thy oil.&quot; It is certainly not accidental that Hosea enumerates the three objects,
just in the same order in which they occur in these two passages. By the celebration
of the feasts, and by the offering of the first-fruits, the Israelites were to give
expression to the acknowledgment, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span> that they
derived these gifts of God from His special providence&mdash;from the covenant relation.
The relative clause <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1513;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span> is subjoined,
as is frequently the case, without a sign of its relation, and without a <i>pron.
suff.</i>, which is manifest from the preceding substantive. Several interpreters,
from the Chaldee Paraphrast down to <i>Ewald</i>, give the explanation, &quot;which they
have made for a Baal,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, from which they have made images of Baal, and
appeal to viii. 4: &quot;Their silver and their gold they have made into idols for themselves.&quot;
But we must object to this opinion on the following grounds. 1.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1513;&#1492;</span>, with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span>
following, is a religious <i>terminus technicus</i>, with the sense of, &quot;to make
to any one,&quot; &quot;to appropriate,&quot; &quot;to dedicate,&quot; as appears from its frequent repetition
in Exod. x. 25 sqq., and also from the fact that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> is frequently omitted. The phrase is used with a reference to idolatry
in 2 Kings xvii. 32; 2 Chron. xxiv. 7.&mdash;2. It cannot be proved that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span>, in the singular and with the Article,
could be used for &quot;statues of Baal.&quot;&mdash;3. By this explanation we lose the striking
contrast between that which the Israelites <i>were doing</i>, and that which they
<i>were to do</i>. That which the Lord gave to them, they consecrated to Baal, instead
of to Him, to whom alone these embodied thanks were due. And, not satisfied in withdrawing
from the true God the honour and thanks which were due to Him, they transferred
them to His enemy and worthless rival,&mdash;a proceeding which bears witness to the deep
corruption of human nature, and which, up to the present day, is continually repeated,
and must be so, because the corruption remains the same. It is substantially the
same thing that the Israelites dedicated their gold to Baal, and that our great
poets consecrate to the world and its prince the rich intellectual gifts which they
have received from God. The words, &quot;and she knew not,&quot; in both cases show that they
are equally guilty and equally culpable. He who bestows the gifts has not concealed
Himself; but they on whom they are bestowed have shut their eyes, that they may
not see Him to whom they are unwilling to render thanks. They would fain wish that
their liberal benefactor were utterly annihilated, in order that they may not be
disturbed in the enjoyment of His gifts by a disagreeable thought of Him,&mdash;in order
that they may freely use and dispose of them, without being obliged to fear their
loss,&mdash;and in order that they may be able to devote them, without any
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span> obstruction, to a god who is like themselves,
who is only their own self viewed objectively (<i>ihr objectivirtes Ich</i>). Parallel
to the passage before us, and, it may be, formed after it, is Ezek. xvi. 17, 18:
&quot;And thou didst take thy ornament of My gold and of My silver which I gave thee,
and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them. And thou
tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and My fat and Mine increase
thou gavest before them.&quot; <i>Hitzig</i> understands, by the Baal here, the golden
calf, appealing to the fact that the real worship of Baal had been abolished by
Jehu. But no proof at all can be adduced for the assertion that the name of Baal
had been transferred to the golden calf. It is self-evident, and is confirmed by
2 Kings xiii. 6, xvii. 16 (in the latter of which passages the worship of Baal appears
as a continuous sin in the kingdom of the ten tribes), that the destruction of the
heathenish worship by Jehu was not absolute. But so much is certain, that by the
mention of Baal, the sin is here designated only with reference to its highest point,
and that, in substance, the service of the calves is here included. In 1 Kings xiv.
9, it is shown that the sin of worshipping Jehovah under the image of calves is
on a par with real idolatry; and in 2 Chron. xi. 15, the calves are put on a footing
with the goat-deities of Egypt.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 11. &quot;<i>Therefore I return, and take My corn in its time,
and My must in its season, and take away My wool and My flax to cover her nakedness.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span> stands here with great
emphasis. It points to the eternal law of God&#39;s government of the world, according
to which He is sanctified <i>upon</i> them, <i>in</i> whom He has not been sanctified;
and this so much the more, the closer was His relation to them, and the greater
were His gifts. From him who is not thereby moved, they will be taken away; and
nothing but his natural poverty and nakedness is left to him who was formerly so
richly endowed. And well is it with him if they be taken from him at a time when
he is able still to recognise the giver in Him who taketh away, and may yet deeply
repent of his unthankfulness, and return to Him, as is said of Israel in iii. 5.
If such be done, it is seen that the ungrateful one has not yet become an object
of divine justice alone, but that divine mercy is still in store for him. The longer
God allows His <span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span> gifts to remain with the ungrateful,
the darker are their prospects for the future. That which He gave in mercy, He,
in such a case, allows to remain only in anger. The words
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;</span> are commonly explained by expositors,
&quot;I shall take again,&quot; inasmuch as two verbs are frequently found together which,
in their connection, are independent of each other&mdash;the one indicating only an accessory
idea of the action. But this mode of expression occurs in general far more rarely
than is commonly assumed; and here the explanation, &quot;I will return and take,&quot; is
to be preferred without any hesitation. Scripture says, that God appears even when
He manifests Himself only in the effects of His omnipotence, justice, and love,&mdash;a
mode of expression which is explained by that large measure of faith which perceives,
behind the visible effect, the invisible Author of it; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Gen.
xviii. 10, where the Lord says to Abraham, that He would return to him at the same
period in the following year; whereas He did not return in a visible form, as then,
but only in the fulfilment of His promise. Thus God had formerly appeared to Israel
as the Giver; and now that they did not acknowledge Him as such. He returns as the
God that takes away. &quot;She did not know that I gave, therefore I shall return and
take.&quot; That the words were to be thus understood, the prophet, as it appears, intended
to indicate by the change of the tenses. It is quite natural that a verb, used as
an adverb, should be as closely as possible connected with that verb which conveys
the principal idea; and it would scarcely be possible to find a single instance&mdash;at
all events there are not many instances&mdash;where, in such a case, a difference of the
tense takes place. Altogether analogous is Jer. xii. 15: &quot;And it shall come to pass
after I have destroyed them, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
I will return and have compassion on them;&quot; where the sense would be very much weakened
if we were to translate, &quot;I shall <i>again</i> have compassion.&quot; There appears to
be the same design in the change of the tenses in iii. 5 also. What is there said
of Israel forms a remarkable parallel to what is here said of God. God had formerly
come, giving&mdash;Israel, taking; God now returns, taking&mdash;Israel giving,&mdash;a relation which
opens up an insight into the whole economy of the sufferings.&mdash;&quot;<i>My</i> corn,&quot;
etc., forms a contrast to ver. 7, where Israel had spoken of all these things as
<i>theirs</i>. Whatever God gives, always remains <span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
His own, because He gives only as a loan, and on certain conditions. If any one
should consider himself as the absolute master of it, He makes him feel his error
by taking it away.&mdash;&quot;In its time&quot; and &quot;in its season&quot; are added, because it was
<i>then</i>, ordinarily, that God had appeared as <i>giving</i>, and because <i>
then</i> they therefore confidently expected His gifts. But now He appears at once
as <i>taking</i>, because they were already so sure of the expected gifts that they
held them, as it were, already in their hands; just as if, at Christmas&mdash;which corresponds
to the harvest, the ordinary season of God&#39;s granting gifts&mdash;parents should withdraw
from their children the accustomed presents, and put a rod in their place. It is
better thus to understand the expression, &quot;in its time, etc.,&quot; than to follow <i>
Jerome</i>, who remarks, that &quot;it is a severe punishment, if at the time of harvest
the hoped-for fruits are taken away, and wrested from our hands;&quot; for if, even at
the time of the harvest, there be a want of all things, how will it be during the
remaining time of the year.&mdash;The words, &quot;to cover, etc.,&quot; are very concise, but without
any grammatical ellipsis, instead of, &quot;which hitherto served to cover her nakedness.&quot;
As to the sense, the LXX. are correct in translating,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8059;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span>. For
that which had <i>hitherto</i> been, is mentioned by the prophet only for the purpose
of drawing attention to what <i>in future</i> will <i>not</i> be.&mdash;It is the Lord
who must cover the nakedness; and this leads us back to the natural poverty of man,
who has not, in the whole world, a single patch or shred&mdash;not even so much as to
cover his shame, which is here specially to be understood by nakedness. The same
thought which is so well calculated to humble pride&mdash;what have we that we have not
received, and that the Giver might not at any moment take back?&mdash;occurs also in Ezek.
xvi. 8: &quot;I spread out My wings over thee, and covered thy nakedness.&quot; </p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. &quot;<i>And now I will uncover her shame before the eyes
of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hands.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; </span>
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;</span> is best explained by &quot;decay,&quot; &quot;<i>corpus
multa stupra passum</i>.&quot; Being a femin. of a Segholate-form, its signification
can be derived only from the <i>Kal</i>; but <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;</span>
always signifies &quot;to be faded, weak, feeble;&quot; in <i>Piel</i> it means, &quot;to make
weak,&quot; &quot;to declare as weak,&quot; &quot;to disgrace,&quot; &quot;to despise.&quot; As the signification of
<i>Kal</i> does not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span> imply the Idea of ignominy,
we cannot explain the noun, as several interpreters do, by &quot;<i>turpitudo</i>, <i>
ignominia</i>.&quot; The <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#8055;&#945;</span> of the LXX. is
probably a free translation of the word according to our view.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;</span>
is constantly used for &quot;<i>coram, inspectante aliquo</i>,&quot; properly, &quot;belonging
to the eyes of some one,&quot; and cannot therefore be explained here by &quot;to the eyes,&quot;
as if she were uncovered to, or for, the lovers alone; these, on the contrary, are
mentioned only as fellow-witnesses. But in what respect do they come into consideration
here? Several interpreters are of opinion that their powerlessness, and the folly
of trusting in them, are intended to be here pointed out. Thus <i>Calvin</i> says:
&quot;The prophet alludes to the impudent women who are wont, even by terror, to prevent
their husbands from using their rights. He says, therefore, this shall not prevent
me from chastising thee as thou deservest.&quot; Thus also <i>Stuck</i>, who subjoins
to the phrase &quot;her lovers:&quot; &quot;who, if they had the strength, might be a help to her.&quot;
But it is altogether erroneous thus to understand the verse. The words, &quot;Before
the eyes of the lovers,&quot; rather mean, that the Lord would make her an object of
disgust and horror even to those who formerly sought after her. The idea is this:
Whosoever forsakes God on account of the world, shall, by God, be put to shame,
even in the eyes of the world itself, and all the more, the more nearly he formerly
stood to Him. This idea is here expressed in a manner suited to the figurative representation
which pervades the whole section. <i>Jerome</i> says: &quot;All this is brought forward
under the figure of the adulterous woman, who, after she has been taken in the very
act, is exposed and disgraced before the eyes of all.&quot; The uncovering, as guilt,
is followed by the uncovering, as punishment; and every one (and her lovers first)
turns away with horror from the disgusting spectacle. They now at once see her who,
hitherto, had made a show with the apparel and goods of her lawful husband, in her
true shape as a withered monster. That this explanation is alone the correct one,
appears from the parallel passages: compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Nah. iii. 5: &quot;Behold,
I come upon thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and uncover thy skirts upon thy face,
and make the heathen to see thy nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame. And it cometh
to pass, all that see thee shall flee from thee:&quot; Lam. i. 8: &quot;Jerusalem hath committed
sin, therefore she has <span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span> become a reproach;
all that honoured her, despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she sigheth
and turneth away;&quot; Jer. xiii. 26: &quot;And I also (as thou hast formerly uncovered)
uncover thy skirts over thy face, and thy shame shall be seen;&quot; Ezek. xvi. 37, 41;
Is. xlvii. 3.&mdash;But now, it might seem that, according to this explanation, not the
idols, but only the nations serving them, can be understood by the lovers. But this
is only in appearance. In order to make the scene more lively, the prophet ascribes
to the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, to them who are nothing, life
and feeling. If they had these, they would act just as it is here described, and
as their worshippers really acted afterwards.&mdash;The second member of the verse, &quot;And
none shall deliver,&quot; etc., is in so far parallel to the first, as both describe
the dreadfulness of the divine judgment. Parallel is v. 14: &quot;For I will be as one
who roars to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Judah: I will tear and go away,
I will take away, and there is no deliverer.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 13. &quot;<i>And I make to cease all her mirth, her feast, and
her new-moon, and her sabbath, and all her festival time.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The feasts served a double purpose. They were days of sacred dedication,
and days of joy; compare Num. x. 10. Israel had violated them in the former character&mdash;just
as at present the sacred days have, throughout the greater part of Christendom,
the name only by way of <i>catachresis</i>&mdash;and, as a merited punishment, they were
taken away by God in the latter character. They had deprived the festival days of
their sacredness; by God, they are deprived of their joy fulness. The prophet, in
order to intimate that he announces the cessation of the festival days as days of
gladness, premises &quot;all her mirth,&quot; to which all that follows stands in the relation
of <i>species</i> to <i>genus</i>. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1493;&#1513;</span> does
not here denote &quot;joyful time:&quot; it might, indeed, according to its formation, have
this signification: but it is never found with it. It here means &quot;joy&quot; itself. (Compare
the parallel passages, Jer. vii. 34; Lam. i. 4: &quot;The ways of Zion do mourn, because
none come to the feasts;&quot; Amos viii. 10: &quot;And I will turn your feasts into mourning,
and all your songs into lamentation;&quot; Lam. v. 15; Is. xxiv. 8, 11.) The three following
nouns were very correctly distinguished by <i>Jerome</i>.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1490;</span>, &quot;feast,&quot; is the designation of the three
annual principal festivals. In addition to these, there was in every month the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span> feast of the new-moon; and in every week,
the Sabbath. This connection is a standing one, which, even in the New Testament
(compare Col. ii. 16), still reverts. The words, &quot;all her festival time,&quot; comprehend
the single <i>species</i> in the designation of the <i>genus</i>. That
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;</span> properly signifies &quot;appointed time,&quot;
then, more specially, &quot;festival time,&quot; &quot;feast,&quot; appears from Lev. xxiii. 4: &quot;These
are the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;</span> of the Lord, the sacred assemblies
which you shall call <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1501;</span>, in their appointed
time.&quot; That the <i>feasts</i> are not a single species co-ordinate with the new-moons
and Sabbaths, but the genus, appears from the fact that in Lev. xxiii. the Sabbath
opens the series of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span>. In a wider
sense, the new-moons also belonged to the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
although they are not enumerated among them in Lev. xxiii. on account of their subordinate
character. In Num. x. 10, Is. i. 14, Ezra iii. 5, the new-moons are mentioned along
with the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span> only as the species by the
side of the genus. But we are at liberty to think only of the feasts appointed by
God; for, otherwise, there would be no room for the application of the <i>lex talionis</i>:&mdash;God
takes from the Israelites only what they had taken from Him. The days of the Baalim
are afterwards specially mentioned in ver. 15. The days of God are taken from them;
for the days of the Baalim they are punished. This much, however, appears from the
passage before us&mdash;and it is placed beyond any doubt by several other passages in
Hosea as well as in Amos&mdash;that, outwardly, the worship, as regulated by the prescriptions
of the Pentateuch, had all along continued. (For the arguments in proof of this
assertion, the author&#39;s <i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,
vol. i., are to be compared.)</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 14. &quot;<i>And I make desolate her vine and fig-tree, whereof
she said, They are the wages of whoredom to me, that my lovers have given me; and
I make them a forest, and the beasts of the field eat them.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The vine and fig-tree, as the two noblest productions of Palestine&mdash;<i>Ispahan</i>,
in the &quot;<i>Excerpta ex vita Saladini</i>,&quot; p. 10, calls them &quot;<i>ambos Francorum

and promises, as the representatives of the rich gifts of God, wherewith He has
blessed this country.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;</span> is often placed
before an entire sentence, to mark it out as being relative in general.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span> It is the looser, instead of the closer connection,
= &quot;of which.&quot;&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span> &quot;wages of prostitution,&quot;
instead of which, in ix. 1 and other passages, the form
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1503;</span> occurs, requires a renewed investigation.
It is commonly derived from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, to which
the signification &quot;<i>largiter donavit, dona distribuit</i>,&quot; is ascribed. But opposed
to this, there is the fact that the root <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>
is, neither in Hebrew, nor in any of the dialects, found with this signification.
It has in Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac, the signification &quot;to laud,&quot; &quot;to praise,&quot;
&quot;to recount.&quot; But besides this <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, there
occurs another <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, not with the general signification
&quot;to give,&quot; but in the special one, &quot;to give a reward of whoredom;&quot; in which signification
it cannot be a primitive word, but derived from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;
&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492; = &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, in the passage under consideration, and in Ezek. xvi. 34. The
supposition of a primitive verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, with
the signification &quot;to give,&quot; is also opposed by the circumstance that the noun which
is said to be derived from it never occurs with the general signification &quot;gift,&quot;
but always with the special one, &quot;reward of prostitution.&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span> is rather derived from the first pers.
Fut. Kal of the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;</span>, a &quot;I will-give-thee,&quot;
similar to our &quot;forget-me-not.&quot; The whore asks, in Gen. xxxviii. 16,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1497;</span> (&quot;what wilt thou give me?&quot;), and
the whoremonger answers, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1498;</span> (&quot;I will give
thee&quot;), ver. 18. From this there originated, in the language of the brothel, a base
word for such base traffic. The sacred writers are not ashamed or afraid to use
it. They speak, throughout, of common things in a common manner; for the vulgar
word is the most suitable for the vulgar thing. The morality of a people, or of
an age, may be measured by their speaking of vulgar things in a vulgar manner, or
the reverse. Wherever, in the language, the &quot;<i>fille de joie</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Freudenmädchen</i>&quot;
has taken the place of the &quot;whore,&quot; a similar change will, in reality, have taken
place. Whatsoever the people of Israel imagined that they received from their idols,
they certainly will not have designated as a &quot;reward of prostitution,&quot; but as a
&quot;reward of true love.&quot; But the prophet at once destroys all their pleasant imaginings
by putting into their mouths the corresponding expression,&mdash;an expression which must
certainly have sounded very rudely and vulgarly in their tender ears; for the tongue
and the ear become more tender, in the same degree in which the heart becomes more
vulgar. She who imagined herself so tender and affectionate sees herself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span> at once addressed as a common prostitute.
The sweet proofs of the heartfelt mutual love which her &quot;lovers&quot; gave her are called
&quot;wages of whoredom.&quot; This is indeed a good corrective for our language, for our
whole view of things, for our own hearts, which are so easily befooled. All love
of the world, all striving after its favour, every surrender to the spirit of the
age, is whoredom. A reward of whoredom, which must not be brought into the temple
of the Lord (for it is an <i>abomination</i> unto the Lord thy God, Deut. xxiii.
19), is everything which it offers and gives us in return. Like a reward of whoredom,
it will melt away; &quot;of wages of whoredom she has collected, and to wages of whoredom
it shall return.&quot;&mdash;This derivation from the Future has a great many analogies in
its favour; among others, the whole class of nouns with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;</span> prefixed, in which it is quite evident (although
this has been so often overlooked) that they have arisen from the Fut. If the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;</span> in these forms originated from the <i>Hiphil</i>,
how could it be explained that they are more frequently connected with <i>Kal</i>?
Even the very common occurrence of the formation from the Future in the case of
proper names, induces us to expect, <i>a priori</i>, that it will be more frequent
in appellative names than is commonly supposed. The occurrence of the phrase
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, in the passages quoted, is also
in favour of this derivation. By it, the interchange of the two forms
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1503;</span>
is easily accounted for. In the latter of these forms, the <i>Nun</i> which prevails
in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;</span>, but which had been dropped at the
beginning, again reappears. A variation in the form is, moreover, quite natural
in a word which originated from common life, which is entirely destitute of accurate
analogies, and is therefore, as it were, without a model; for the other nouns of
this class are formed from the 3d pers. of the <i>Fut.</i>&mdash;As regards, now, the
substance:&mdash;Egotism, and selfishness arising out of it, are the ground of all desire
for the love of that which is not God, especially in the case of those who have
already known the true God; for where this is not the case, there may be, even in
idolatry, a better element, which seeks for a false gratification only because it
does not know the true one. From this, however, it appears, that the idolatry of
the Israelites (and this is only a species of the idolatry of all those who have
had opportunity to know the true God, and of whom it is true that &quot;the last is worse
than the first&quot;) was <span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span> much lower than that
of the Gentiles, whose poets and philosophers, in part, zealously opposed the dispositions
which are here expressed; compare the passages in <i>Manger</i>. Egotism is here,
as it always is, folly; for it trusts in him who himself possesses only borrowed
and stolen goods, which the lawful owner may, at every moment, take away from him.
And in order that such folly may appear as such, and very glaringly too. He appears
here indeed, and takes what He had in reality given out of His mercy, but what,
according to their imagination, they had received from the idols as a reward.&mdash;The
suffix in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;</span> refers to the vine and fig-tree.
The gardens of vines and fig-trees carefully tended, hedged and enclosed round about,
are to be deprived of hedges, enclosures, and culture (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#8150;

to be changed into a forest, and given over to the ravages of wild beasts; for the
words &quot;and eat them&quot; are by no means to be referred<!--1854 ed--> to the fruits
only. The same image of an entirely devastated country is found in Is. vii. 23 ff.;
Mic. iii. 12.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 15. &quot;<i>And I visit upon her the days of the Baalim, to whom
she burnt incense, and put on her ring and her ornament, and went after her lovers,
and forgat Me, saith the Lord.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The days of the Baalim are the days consecrated to their worship,
whether they were specially set apart for that purpose, or whether they were originally
devoted to the worship of the Lord, whom they sought to confound with Baal. <i>Manger</i>,
and with him, most interpreters, are wrong in understanding by the days of Baal,
&quot;all the time&mdash;certainly a very long one&mdash;in which that forbidden worship flourished
in this nation.&quot; Such would be too indefinite an expression. When days of the Baalim
are spoken of, every one must think of days specially consecrated to them,&mdash;their
festivals. To this must be added, moreover, the reference to the days of the Lord
in ver. 13. In ver. 10, however, only one Baal, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span>,
is spoken of; here there are several. This may be reconciled by the supposition
that one and the same Baal was worshipped according to his various modes of manifestation
which were expressed by the epithets. But the plural may also be explained&mdash;and this
seems to be preferable&mdash;from 1 Kings xviii. 18, where Baalim is tantamount to Baal
and his associates (compare <i>Dissertations on the Gen. of the Pent.</i> vol. i.
p. 165); or from Lev. xvii. 7, where <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>
denotes the Goat-idol, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span> and others of his kind.
The calves, the worship of which was, at the time of Hosea, the prevailing one throughout
the kingdom of the ten tribes, are, in that case, comprehended in the Baalim.&mdash;In
the words, &quot;And she put on her ring and ornament,&quot; the figurative mode of expression
has been overlooked by most interpreters. Misled by the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, which refers directly to the spiritual
adulteress, they imagined that the wearing of nose-rings, and other ornaments, in
honour of the idols, was here spoken of. A more correct view was held by the Chaldee
who thus paraphrases: &quot;The Congregation of Israel was like a wife who deserted her
husband, and adorned herself, and ran after her lovers. Thus the Congregation of
Israel was pleased to worship idols, and to neglect My worship.&quot; A great many false
interpretations have had their origin in the circumstance, that they could not comprehend
this liberty of the sacred writers, who at one time speak plainly of the spiritual
antitype, and at another time transfer to it the peculiarities of the outward type.
Had this been kept in view, it would not, <i>e.g.</i>, have been asserted, that
David had, in Ps. xxiii. 5, relinquished the image of the good shepherd, because
he does not speak of a trough which the actual good shepherd places before his sheep,
but of a table, placed before them by the spiritual good Shepherd. In the passage
under consideration, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;</span> denotes an
action performed by her who is an adulteress in a spiritual point of view. In the
words, &quot;She puts on,&quot; etc., her conduct is described under the figure of that of
her outward type. The actual correspondence is to be found in her efforts of making
herself agreeable,&mdash;in the employing of every means in order to gain her spiritual
lovers. The putting on of precious ornaments comes into view, only in so far as
it is one of these efforts, and, indeed, a very subordinate one. The burning of
incense, the offering of sacrifices, etc., are, in this respect, of far greater
importance. The correctness of our interpretation is confirmed by those parallel
passages also, in which the same figurative mode of expression occurs. Thus, <i>
e.g.</i>, Is. lvii. 9: &quot;Thou lookest upon the king (the common translation, &quot;thou
goest to the king,&quot; cannot be defended on philological grounds) in oil (<i>i.e.</i>,
smelling of ointment), and multipliest thy perfume,&quot;&mdash;evidently a figurative designation,
taken from a coquetish woman, to express the employing of all means in, order to
gain favour;&mdash;Is. iv. 30: <span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span> &quot;And thou desolate
one, what wilt thou do? For thou puttest on thy purple, for thou adornest thyself
with golden ornaments, for thou rentest thine eyes with painting. In vain thou makest
thyself fair; the lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.&quot; In Ezek. xxii. 40-42,
Jerusalem washes and paints herself, expecting her lovers, and decks herself with
ornaments; then she sits down upon a stately couch; a table is prepared before her,
upon which she places the incense of the Lord, and His oil. In this last feature
in Ezekiel, the type disappears behind the thing typified, although not so completely
as is the case in the passage under consideration, in the words, &quot;She burns incense.&quot;&mdash;From
what has been remarked, it appears that, in substance, Hos. iv. 13, &quot;They sacrifice
upon the tops of the mountains and bum incense upon the hills,&quot; is entirely parallel.
The two clauses, &quot;She went after her lovers,&quot; and &quot;she forgat Me,&quot; both serve to
represent the crime in a more heinous light. Sin must certainly have already poisoned
the whole heart, if occasion for its exercise be spontaneously sought after. In
reference to the latter, <i>Calvin</i> remarks: &quot;Just as when a wife has for a long
time lived with her husband, and has been kindly and liberally treated by him, and
then prostitutes herself to lovers, and does not entertain or retain any more love
for him; such a depravity is nothing less than brutish.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 16. &quot;<i>Therefore, behold, I allure her, and lead her into
the wilderness and speak to her heart.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The consolation and promise here begin with as great abruptness
as in the first section. It is reported how the Lord gradually leads back His unfaithful
wife to reformation, and to reunion with Him, the lawful husband. Great difficulty
has been occasioned to interpreters by the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span>
at the commencement. Very easily, but at the same time very inconsiderately, the
difficulty is got over by those who give it the signification, &quot;<i>utique</i>,
<i>profecto</i>;&quot; but this cannot be called interpreting. It must be, above all,
considered as settled and undoubted, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span>
can here have that signification only which it always has; and this all the more,
that in vers. 8 and 15 it occurred in the same signification. This being taken for
granted, the &quot;therefore&quot; might be referred to the words of the wife in ver. 9, &quot;I
will go and return to my first husband,&quot; and all which follows be considered as
only a kind of parenthesis. That the Lord begins again to show Himself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span> kind to His wife would then have its foundation
in this:&mdash;that in her the first symptoms of a change of character manifested themselves.
But this supposition is, after all, too forced. These words are too far away as
that the prophet could have expected to be understood, in thus referring to them
in a manner so indefinite. Several interpreters follow the explanation of <i>Tarnovius</i>:
&quot;Therefore, because she is not corrected by so great calamities, I will try the
matter in another and more lenient way, by kindness.&quot; But the prophet could not
expect that his hearers and readers should themselves supply the thought, which
is not indicated by anything,&mdash;the thought, namely, &quot;because that former method was
of no avail, or rather, because it <i>alone</i> did not suffice;&quot; for it was by
no means wholly in vain. When the Lord had hedged up her way with thorns, the woman
speaks: &quot;I will go and return;&quot; and where tribulations are of no avail&mdash;tribulations
through which we must enter the kingdom of God&mdash;nothing else will. The severity of
God must precede His love. And even though this train of thought should have occurred
to them, they had no guarantee for its correctness. It is most natural to take the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span> as being simply co-ordinate with the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span> in vers. 8 and 11. The &quot;<i>because</i>,&quot;
which, in all the three places, corresponds to the <i>therefore</i>, is the wife&#39;s
apostasy. Because she has forgotten God, He recalls Himself to her remembrance,
first by the punishment, and then, after this has attained its end,&mdash;after the wife
has spoken: &quot;I will go and return,&quot;&mdash;by proofs of His love. The leading to Egypt,
into the wilderness, into the land of Canaan, rests on her unfaithfulness as its
foundation. Without it, the Congregation would have remained in undisturbed possession
of the promised land. By it, God is induced, both according to His justice and His
mercy, to take it from her, to lead her back into the wilderness, and thence to
the promised land.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1492;</span>, in the <i>Piel</i>,
is a <i>verbum amatorium</i>; it signifies &quot;to allure by tender persuasion.&quot; There
is to be a repetition of the proceeding of God, by which He formerly, in Egypt,
allured the people to Himself, and induced them to follow Him into the wilderness,
from the spiritual and bodily bondage in Egypt. After the sufferings, there always
follows the alluring. God first takes away the objects of sinful love, and then
He comes alluring and persuading us that we should choose, for the object of our
love. Him who alone is worthy of, and entitled to, love. He is not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span> satisfied with the strict prosecution of His
right, but endeavours to make duty sweet to us, and, by His love, to bring it about
that we perform it from love. After He has thus allured us. He leads us from Egypt
into the wilderness.&mdash;The words, &quot;I lead her into the wilderness,&quot; have been very
much misunderstood by interpreters. According to <i>Manger</i>, the wilderness here
is that through which the captives should pass on their return from Babylon. But
one reason alone is sufficient to refute this opinion,&mdash;namely, that on account of
the following verse, by the wilderness (the article must not be overlooked), only
that wilderness can be understood which separates Egypt from Canaan. Others (<i>Ewald</i>,
<i>Hitzig</i>), following <i>Grotius</i>, understand by the wilderness, the Assyrian
captivity. <i>Kuehnöl</i> has acquired great merit for this exposition, by proving
from a passage in <i>Herodotus</i>, that there were, at that time, uncultivated
regions in Assyria! The same reason which militates against the former interpretation
is opposed to this also. To this it may be further added, that, according to it,
we can make nothing of the <i>alluring</i>. The Israelites were not <i>allured</i>
into captivity by kindness and love; they were driven into it <i>against</i> their
will, by God&#39;s wrath. <i>Moreover</i>, what according to this interpretation is
to be done with the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1501;</span> in ver. 17? Did, perhaps,
the vineyards of Canaan begin immediately beyond Assyria, or does not even this
rather lead us to the Arabian desert? It is certain, then, that this desert is the
one to be thought of here, and, in addition, that it can only be as an image and
type that the prophet here represents the leading through the wilderness, as a repetition
of the former one in its individual form; inasmuch as it was, substantially, equal
with it. For they who returned from the Assyrian captivity could not well pass through
the literal Arabian desert; and the comparison expressed in the following verse,
&quot;As in the day when she went up from the land of Egypt,&quot; shows that here also a
<i>decurtata comparatio</i> must take place. But, now, all depends upon determining
the essential feature, the real nature and substance, of that first leading through
the wilderness; because the leading spoken of in the verse before us must have that
essential feature in common with it. The principal passage&mdash;which must guide us in
this investigation, and which is proved to be such by the circumstance that the
Lord Himself referred <span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span> to it when He was <i>
spiritually</i> led through the wilderness, an event which, for a sign, <i>outwardly</i>
also took place in the wilderness&mdash;is Deut. viii. 2-5: &quot;And thou shalt remember all
the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to
afflict thee and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst
keep His commandments, or no. And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger,
and fed thee with the manna which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know,
that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything
which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not
old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell these forty years. And thou knowest in
thine heart, that as a father chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth
thee.&quot; The essential feature in the leading through the wilderness is, accordingly,
the <i>temptation</i>. By the wonderful manifestations of the Lord&#39;s omnipotence
and mercy, on the occasion of Israel&#39;s deliverance from Egypt, a heartfelt love
to Him had been awakened in the people. (Compare the tender expression of it in
the Song in Exod. xv.; and also the passage in Jer. ii. 2: &quot;I remember thee, the
kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, thy going after Me in the wilderness
in a land not sown,&quot;&mdash;which cannot but refer to the very first time of the abode
in the wilderness, before the giving of the law on Sinai, as is evident from the
mention of the youth and espousals; for the latter ceased on Sinai, where the marriage
took place.) The whole conduct of the people at the giving of the law,&mdash;their great
readiness in promising to do all that the Lord should command,&mdash;likewise bear testimony
to this love. The Lord&#39;s heartfelt delight in Israel during the first period of
their marching through the wilderness, of which Hosea speaks in ix. 10, likewise
presupposes this love. Thus the first station was reached. The people now hoped
to be put in immediate possession of the inheritance promised to them by the Lord.
But, because the Lord knew the condition of human nature. His way was a different
one. A state of temptation and trial succeeded that of entire alienation from God.
The first love is but too often&mdash;nay, it is, more or less, always&mdash;but a flickering
flame. Sin has not been entirely slain; it has been only subdued for a moment, and
only wants a favourable opportunity <span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span> to regain
its old dominion. It would never be thoroughly destroyed, if God allowed this condition
always to continue; if by always putting on new fuel, if by uninterrupted proofs
of His love. He were to keep that fire burning continually. If the love of the feelings
and imagination is to become a cordial, thorough moral love, it requires to be tried,
in order that thus it may recognise its own nothingness hitherto, and how necessary
it is that it should take deeper root. The means of this trial are God&#39;s afflicting
us, concealing Himself from us, leading us in a way different from that which we
expected, and, apparently, forsaking vis. But because He is the merciful One who
will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able,&mdash;because He Himself has
commanded us to pray, &quot;Lead us not into temptation,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, into such an one
as we are not able to bear, and would thereby become a temptation inwardly,&mdash;He makes
His gifts to go by the side of His chastisements. He who suffered Israel to hunger,
gave them also to eat. He who suffered them to thirst, gave them also to drink.
He who led them over the burning sand, did not suffer their shoes to wax old. But
this counterpoise to tribulation becomes, in another aspect, a new temptation. As
Satan tries to overthrow us by pleasure as well as by pain; so God proves us by
what He gives, no less than by what He takes away. In the latter case, it will be
seen whether we love God <i>without</i> His gifts; in the former, whether we love
Him in His gifts. This second station is, to many, the last; the bodies of many
fall in the wilderness. But while a multitude of individuals remain there, the Congregation
of God always passes over to the third station,&mdash;the possession of Canaan. The state
of temptation is, to her, always a state of sifting and purification at the same
time. That which is to the individual a calamity, is to her a blessing.&mdash;That we
have thus correctly defined the nature and substance of the leading through the
wilderness, is confirmed by the temptation of Christ also, which immediately succeeded
the bestowal of the Spirit, which again corresponded to the first love. That this
temptation of Christ corresponded to the leading through the wilderness&mdash;in so far
as it could do so in the case of Him who was tempted in all things, yet without
sin; while in our case, there is no temptation, even when resisted
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span> victoriously, that is without sin&mdash;appears
sufficiently from its two external characteristics, viz., the stay in the wilderness,
and the forty days; but still more so, from the internal feature,&mdash;the fact that
the Saviour, in order to show the tempter that He recognised in His own case a repetition
of the stay in the wilderness, opposed Him with a passage taken from the <i>locus
classicus</i> concerning it, already quoted.&mdash;We now, moreover, cite the parallel
passages which serve as an explanation of the passage under consideration, and as
a confirmation of the explanation which we have given. The most important is Ezek.
xx. 34-38: &quot;And I bring you <i>out from the nations</i>, and gather you out of the
countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand and with a stretched-out
arm, and with fury poured out. And I bring you into the <i>wilderness of the nations</i>,
and there will I plead with you face to face; like as I pleaded with your fathers
in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead there with you, saith the
Lord God. And I cause you to pass under the rod, and bring you into the bond of
the covenant, and purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress
against Me; out of the land of your pilgrimage (the standing designation of Egypt
in the Pentateuch) I will bring them forth, and into the land of Israel they shall
not come, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.&quot; Here also, the stay in the wilderness
appears as a state of trial, lying in the middle between the abode among the nations
(corresponding to the bondage in Egypt, which was so not merely bodily, but spiritual
also), and the possession of Canaan. And the result of this trial is a different
one, according to the different condition of the individuals. Some shall be altogether
destroyed; even the appearance of the communion with the Lord, which they hitherto
maintained by having come out of the land of pilgrimage along with the others, shall
be taken away; whilst the others, by the very means which brought about the destruction
of the former, shall be confirmed in their communion with the Lord, and be more
closely united to Him. Hosea, who, in consequence of the personification of the
Congregation of Israel, has the whole more in view, regards chiefly the latter feature.
A very remarkable circumstance in Ezekiel, however, requires to be still more minutely
considered; because it promotes essentially the right understanding of the passage
before us. What is meant <span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span> by the &quot;wilderness
of the nations?&quot; Several interpreters think that it is the wilderness between Babylon
and Judea. Thus, for example, <i>Manger</i>: &quot;<i>I am disposed to think</i> that
the desert of Arabia itself is here called the wilderness of the nations, on account
of the different nomadic tribes which are accustomed to wander through it.&quot; <i>Rosenmüller</i>
says: &quot;He <i>seems</i> to speak here of those vast solitudes which the Jews had
to pass through, on their way from Babylon to Judea.&quot; But this &quot;I am disposed to
think,&quot; and this &quot;he seems,&quot; on the part of these interpreters, show that they themselves
felt the insufficiency of their own explanation. That nomadic tribes are straying
through that wilderness, is not at all essential, and can therefore not be mentioned
here, where only the essential feature&mdash;the nature and substance of the leading through
the wilderness&mdash;are concerned. And we cannot at all perceive why just the wilderness
between Babylon and Judea should be called the wilderness of the nations. It was
no more travelled by nomadic tribes than was any other wilderness. And just as little
was it characteristic of it, that it bordered upon the territories of various nations
(<i>Hitzig</i>). Such a designation would throw us upon the territory of mere conjecture,
on which we are, in Holy Scripture, never thrown, except through our own fault.
But it is quite decisive that the words, &quot;I bring you out of the wilderness of the
nations,&quot; stand in a close relation to the words, &quot;I bring you out from the nations.&quot;
From this it appears that the nations, to which the Israelites are to be brought,
cannot be any other than those, out of the midst of whom they are to be led. In
the first leading out of the Israelites, the two spiritual conditions were separated
externally also. The first belonged to Egypt; the second, to the wilderness. But
it shall not be thus, in this announced repetition of the leading. It is only spiritually
that the Israelites, at the commencement of the second condition, shall be led out
from among the nations, in the midst of whom they, outwardly, still continue to
be. The wilderness is in the second Egypt itself. The stay in the wilderness is
repeated as to its essence only, and not as to its accidental outward form; just
as in Zech. x. 12, the words, &quot;And he passeth through the sea,&quot; which apparently
might imply a repetition of the outward form merely, are limited to the substance
by the subjoined &quot;affliction.&quot; From this we obtain for our passage (<i>Hitzig</i>
likewise <span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span> remarks: Ezek. xx. 34-38 seems to
depend on Hosea ii. 16) the important result, that the leading of God which is here
announced, is not limited to a definite place, and as little, to a definite time.
And what is true of the leading through the wilderness, must necessarily apply to
the leading into Canaan also. Just as Egypt might begin, and actually did begin,
even in Palestine, inasmuch as Israel was there in a condition of heavy spiritual
and bodily bondage;&mdash;just as, spiritually, they might already be in the wilderness,
though, outwardly, they were still under Asshur; so, the stay in the wilderness
might, relatively, have still continued in Canaan, even although&mdash;which did not happen&mdash;the
whole people should have returned thither with Zerubbabel. What is it that makes
Canaan to be Canaan, the promised land, the land of the Lord? It is just this:&mdash;that
the Lord is there present with all His gifts and blessings. But such was by no means
the case in the new colony. Because the spiritual condition of those who had returned
was in conformity with the second&mdash;in part, even with the first&mdash;rather than with.
the last station, their outward condition was so likewise. John the Baptist symbolized
this continuation of the condition of the wilderness, by his appearing <i>in the
wilderness</i>, with the preaching of repentance, and with. the announcement, that
now the introduction to the true Canaan was near at hand. By proclaiming himself
as the voice crying in the wilderness, announced by Isaiah, he showed with sufficient
plainness how false was that carnal view which, without being able to distinguish
the thought from its drapery, understood, and still understands, by the wilderness
spoken of in this prophecy, some piece of land, limited as to space, and then murmured
that the actual limit did not correspond with the fancied one.&mdash;As in the case of
Israel, so in ours also, these conditions are distinguished, not absolutely, but
relatively only. Even he who has, in one respect, been already led through to Canaan,
remains, in another respect, in the wilderness still. Canaan, in the full sense,
does not belong to the present world, but to the future, as regards both the single
individual, and the whole Church.&mdash;Another parallel passage is Jer. xxxi. 1, 2: &quot;At
this time, saith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and
they shall be My people. Thus saith the Lord, The people who have escaped from the
sword find mercy in the wilderness; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span> I go to
give rest to Israel.&quot; In Rev. xii. 6, 14, the wilderness likewise designates the
state of trial and temptation.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;</span>,
properly &quot;to speak over the heart,&quot; because the words fall down upon the heart,
signifies an affectionate and consolatory address; compare Gen. xxxiv. 3 (&quot;And he
loved the damsel, and spoke over the heart of the damsel&quot;), l. 21; Is. xl. 2. Here
they signify that the wife is comforted after she had been so deeply cast down by
the consciousness of her former unfaithfulness, and by the experience of its bitter
consequences. The view of those who would here think only of the comforting words
of the prophets is much too limited,&mdash;although these words are, of course, included.
We must chiefly think of the <i>sermo realis</i> of the Lord, of all the proofs
of affectionate and tender love, whereby He gives rest to the weary and heavy-laden,
and brings it about, that those who were formerly unfaithful, but who now suffer
themselves to be led by Him out of the spiritual bondage into the spiritual wilderness,
can now put confidence in Him; just as, formerly. He comforted Israel in the wilderness,
in the waste and desolate land, in the land of drought and of the shadow of death
(Jer. ii. 6), and affectionately cared for all their wants, in order that they might
know that He is the Lord their God, Deut. xxix. 4, 5.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 17. &quot;<i>And I give her her vineyards from thence, and the
valley of Achor</i> (trouble) <i>for a door of hope; and she answers thither as
in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of Egypt.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The same faithful love which led into the wilderness, now leads
into Canaan also; and the entrance into the promised land is immediately followed
by the possession of all its gifts and blessings, which now legitimately belong
to the <i>faithful</i> wife (<i>her</i> vineyards), whilst, formerly, they were
taken from the unfaithful wife by the giver, ver. 14.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span>
of the person, always means &quot;to give to some one.&quot; Hence <i>Simson</i> is wrong
in giving the explanation: &quot;And I make her of it, viz., the wilderness, her vineyards;&quot;
for the valley of Achor was not situated in the wilderness, but in Canaan; compare
Is. lxv. 10. The signification &quot;to give&quot; is here suited to the second member of
the verse also. The valley of Achor is given to her in its quality as a valley of
hope. The <i>vineyards</i> are mentioned with reference to ver. 14, where the devastation
of the vine is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span> threatened. They are brought
under notice as the noblest possession, as the finest ornament of the cultivated
land, in contrast with the barren wilderness. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1501;</span>,
properly &quot;from thence,&quot; is correctly explained by <i>Manger</i>: &quot;As soon as she
has come out of that wilderness.&quot; The explanation of <i>Rödiger</i> and others,
&quot;From that time,&quot; is unphilological; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501;</span> is
never an adverb of time.--According to the opinion of many interpreters (<i>Calvin</i>,
<i>Manger</i>, and others), the valley of Achor here comes into consideration only
because of its fruitfulness, and its situation at the entrance of the promised land,
but not with any reference to the event which, according to Josh. vii., happened
there. But the circumstance that here, as in the whole preceding context, the prophet,
in almost every word, has before his eyes the former leadings of Israel, compels
us, almost involuntarily, to have respect to that event. And, in addition, there
is a still more decisive argument. It cannot be denied that there is a contrast
between what the valley of Achor is by nature, and what it is made by the Lord;
there is too plain a contrast between the <i>hope</i> and the <i>affliction</i>.
But if thus the meaning of the name is brought into view, then certainly there must
also be a reference to the event to which it owed its name. But in order to have
a right understanding of this reference, we must find out what was the essential
feature in the event, the repetition of which is here announced. The people, when
they were entering into Canaan, were immediately deprived of the enjoyment of the
divine favour by the transgression of an individual--Achan--which was only a single
fruit from the tree of the sin which was common to all. But God Himself, in His
mercy, made known the means by which the lost favour might be recovered; and thus
the place, which seemed to be the door of destruction, became the door of hope;
compare <i>Schultens</i> on <i>Harari</i> iii. p. 180. The remembrance of this event
was perpetuated by the name of the place; compare ver. 25: &quot;And Joshua said. Why
hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day. Therefore the name
of the place was called. The valley of Achor, unto this day.&quot; This particular dealing
of God, however, is based upon His nature, and must, therefore, repeat itself when
Israel again comes into similar circumstances,--must be repeated, in general, whensoever
similar conditions arise. Even they who have already entered the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>promised land, who have already come to the
full enjoyment of salvation (<i>full</i>, in so far as it is considered as a whole,
and designated as the last station; but as this last station again has several steps
and gradations, this fulness can be relative only. If it were absolute, if nothing
more of the wilderness were left, then, of course, the case here in question could
no more occur; for a salvation absolutely full presupposes a righteousness absolutely
full);&mdash;even they who have already come to the full enjoyment of salvation, and to
a degree of righteousness corresponding to this salvation, require still the mercy
of God; for, without it, they would soon lose their salvation again. This mercy,
however, is vouchsafed to them in abundant measure. The whole manner in which God
leads those who have obtained mercy, is a changing of the valley of trouble into
a door of hope. He will order all things in such a way, that the bond of union betwixt
Him and those for whom all things must work together for good, instead of being
broken by sin&mdash;as it would be if He were justice alone&mdash;is only the more strengthened.
The same idea occurs again in ver. 21. The new marriage-covenant is there founded
not on justice only, but on mercy also.&mdash;The words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; &#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> are commonly explained, &quot;She sings there,&quot; or, &quot;She there raises
alternative songs.&quot; But both of these interpretations are unphilological. For 1.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> does not signify &quot;there,&quot; but &quot;thither.&quot;
Those passages which have been appealed to for the purpose of proving that it may
also sometimes signify &quot;there,&quot; or &quot;at yonder place,&quot; all belong to the same class.
The opposite of the construction of the verbs of motion with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> takes place in them. As, in these verbs,
the idea of rest is, for the sake of brevity, omitted, so here, that of motion.
Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, Jer. xviii. 2, &quot;Go down to the potter&#39;s house, and <i>thither</i>
will I cause thee to hear My voice,&quot; is a concise mode of expression for, &quot;I will
send My voice thither, and cause thee to hear there;&quot; 1 Chron. iv. 41, &quot;Which were
found thither,&quot; instead of, &quot;which were found there when they came thither.&quot; We
might, in the case of the passage under consideration, most easily concede what
we are contending against, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> is used
instead of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501;</span>, as a kind of grammatical blunder;
but that the writer knew the difference between these two forms clearly appears
from the close of the verse, where, certainly, he would not have put
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> for <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501;</span>.
These are the instances adduced by <i>Winer</i>. <i>Gesenius</i>, further, refers
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>to Is. xxxiv. 15: &quot;<i>Thither</i> makes her
nest;&quot; but the making of the nest implies the placing of it. <i>Ewald</i>, moreover,
appeals to Ps. cxxii. 5: &quot;<i>Thither</i> sit the thrones for judgment.&quot; It is true
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1489;</span> never signifies &quot;to sit down,&quot; but
it frequently implies it. He appeals, further, to the Song of Solomon viii. 5: &quot;<i>Thither</i>
thy mother brought thee forth;&quot; which is tantamount to&mdash;there she brought thee forth,
and put thee down. But <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> can so much the
less signify &quot;there,&quot; that the instances alleged for the weakening of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;</span> <i>locale</i> in other passages, will not
stand the test. <i>Ewald</i> appeals to Ps. lxviii. 7: &quot;God makes the solitary to
dwell <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;</span>;&quot; which, however, does not mean
&quot;<i>in</i> the house,&quot; as <i>Ewald</i> translates, but &quot;<i>into</i> the house&quot;&mdash;He
leads them thither, and makes them to dwell there. The idea of motion being sufficiently
indicated by the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;</span> itself, no other designation
was required in poetry, which delights in brevity. <i>Further</i>&mdash;Hab. iii. 11:
&quot;Sun and moon stand <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, towards their habitation,&quot;
<i>i.e.</i>, go into their habitation and stand there. 2. The verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;</span> signifies neither &quot;to begin the discourse,&quot;
nor &quot;to sing,&quot; nor &quot;to sing alternately,&quot; nor &quot;to correspond,&quot; nor &quot;to be favourably
disposed&quot; (<i>Ewald</i>), nor &quot;to obey&quot; (<i>Hitzig</i>), but always, and everywhere,
&quot;to answer.&quot; All these explanations will lose their plausibility, if we only consider,
that it is not always necessary that a question be expressed by words, but that
it may be implied in the thing itself&mdash;especially in the case of the lively Orientals,
for whom things, even the most mute, have a language. As examples, we cite only
1 Sam. xxi. 12:&mdash;Did they not answer to him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his
thousands, but David his ten thousands!&quot; Similarly also xxix. 5. That even here,
the signification &quot;to answer&quot; ought to be retained, is plain from xviii. 7, compared
with ver. 6. The coming together of David and Saul was a silent question as to which
was the greater. Ps. cxlvii.: &quot;Answer the Lord with praise.&quot; The real addresses
of the Lord were His blessings; compare vers. 2-6, 8 ff. By everything which God
gives He asks. What art thou doing to Me, since I am doing that to thee?
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;</span> is often used of God, although no formal
question or prayer preceded; but the very relation itself implies prayer and asking.
It is in this sense that even the ravens are said to cry to God. It is in this sense
that God <i>answers</i> His people before they cry to Him. He who has nothing, prays
by this very circumstance, even without words, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>yea,
even without the gestures and posture of one who is praying. Since, in these remarks,
we have already refuted the arguments which seemed most plausible, we may pass over
other objections which are less to the purpose. There is only the passage Exod.
xv. 21, which requires to be specially noticed, as it is in that passage that the
signification &quot;to sing alternately&quot; is supposed, beyond any doubt, to be; and many
interpreters assume that there is a verbal reference to it in the passage under
consideration. &quot;And then Miriam answered to them (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, to the men), Sing ye to the Lord,&quot; Moses sings first with the children
of Israel, ver. 1, &quot;and then Miriam the prophetess took, etc., and <i>answered</i>.&quot;
The signification &quot;to answer,&quot; is here quite evident. But, on the other hand, it
appears that that passage has not the slightest relation to the one under consideration,
inasmuch as there is not, in the latter, any mention of a first choir, to which
the second answers.&mdash;From what has been hitherto remarked, it is settled that the
translation, &quot;And she answers thither,&quot; is alone admissible. But now, since no
<i>verbal</i> question or address has preceded here, the question arises:&mdash;Which
address by deeds called forth the answer? To this question an answer is readily
suggested by the reference of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span> to the preceding
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1501;</span>. The address must have come from that
place to which the answer is sent; hence, it can consist only in the giving of the
vineyards, and of the good things of the promised land generally. On entering into
it, she is welcomed by this affectionate address of the Lord, her husband, and there
she answers it. The following words, &quot;As in the days,&quot; etc., show what that is in
which the answer consists. If, at that time, Israel answered the Lord by a song
of praise, full of thanks for the deliverance from Egypt, now also they will answer
Him by a song of praise, for being led into Canaan. If history had given any report
of a hymn of praise sung by Israel when they entered into Canaan, the prophet would
have referred to it; but as it was, he could only remind them of that hymn. And
although the occasion on which it was sung did not altogether correspond, it must
be borne in mind, that in this hymn (compare ver. 12 ff.) the passing through the
Red Sea is represented as a preparatory step, and as prefiguring the occupation
of Canaan&mdash;the latter being contained in it as in a germ. It is, moreover, self-evident
that the essential fundamental thought is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>only
that of the cordial and deep gratitude of the redeemed,&mdash;that the form only is borrowed
from the previous manifestation of this thankfulness. An image altogether similar,
and arising from the same cause, is found in Is. xii. also, where the reference
to Moses&#39; hymn of thanks is manifested by employing the very words; and likewise
in Is. xxvi.; and, further, in Hab. iii. and Rev. xv. 3.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;</span>
and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;</span> are Nominatives, not Accusatives;
which latter could not be made use of here, because the discourse is not of an action
extending through the whole period, but of one happening at a particular point of
that period. The comparison is here also merely intimated, because the <i>tertium
comparationis</i> is abundantly evident from what precedes: &quot;As the days of her
youth,&quot; instead of, &quot;As she once answered in the days of her youth.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 18. &quot;<i>And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, thou
shalt call Me, My husband, and shall call Me no more, My Baal.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The full performance of her duties corresponds with the full admission
to her rights. The prophet expresses this thought, by announcing the removal of
the two forms in which the apostasy of the people from the true God&mdash;the violation
of the marriage-covenant which rested on exclusiveness&mdash;was at that time manifested.
One of these was the mixing up of the religion of Jehovah with heathenism, according
to which they called the true God &quot;Baal,&quot; and worshipped Him as Baal; the other
was still grosser&mdash;was pure idolatry. The abolition of the former (compare above,
p. 176 f.) is predicted in this verse; the abolition of the latter, in the verse
following. Both are in a similar way placed beside each other in Zech. xiv. 9: &quot;In
that day shall there be one Lord, and His name one;&quot; where the first clause refers
to the abolition of polytheism, and the second to the abolition of the mixing of
religion&mdash;of the hidden apostasy&mdash;which, without venturing to forsake the true God
entirely and openly, endeavours to mix up and identify Him with the world. To the
fundamental thought there are several parallels; <i>e.g.</i>, Deut. xxx. 5 ff.:
&quot;And the Lord thy God bringeth thee into the land which thy fathers possessed; and
the Lord thy God circumciseth thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the
Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.&quot;
This passage shows that the verse before us, no less than that which precedes, contains
a <i>promise</i>, and that the &quot;calling,&quot; and the &quot;calling no more,&quot; is a work of
divine <span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>grace. To this we are led also by the
words, &quot;I shall take away,&quot; in ver. 19, as well as by the other parallel passages:&mdash;Jer.
xxiv. 7: &quot;And I give them an heart to know Me, that I am the Lord; and they shall
be a people to Me, and I will be a God to them, for they shall return to Me with
their whole heart;&quot; Ezek. xi. 19: &quot;And I give them one heart, and a new spirit I
put within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh;&quot; compare further Zech.
xiii. 2. Another interpretation of the verse recommends itself by its apparent depth.
According to it, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span> is to be taken as an
appellative noun, the &quot;marriage-Lord,&quot; in contrast with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;</span>, &quot;husband,&quot; and that the people are henceforth
to be altogether governed by love. But this interpretation must be objected to,
for a whole multitude of reasons. There is, <i>first</i> of all, the relation of
this verse to the following one, which does not allow that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span>, which there occurs as a proper name,
should in this place be taken as an appellative. There is, <i>then</i>, the arbitrariness
in defining the relation between <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span>, the former of which as little exclusively
expresses the relation of love, as the latter excludes it. (Compare Is. liv. 5,
6, lxii. 4; 2 Sam. xi. 26.) Further, it is incorrect to say that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;</span> properly means &quot;Lord;&quot; it means &quot;possessor.&quot;
<i>Still further</i>,&mdash;There is the unsuitableness of the thought, which would be
without any analogy in its favour throughout Scripture. And, <i>lastly</i>, the
relation of love to God cannot, even in its highest consummation, do away with reference
to Him, etc.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 19. &quot;<i>And I take away the names of the Baalim out of her
mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The people are to conceive such an abhorrence of idolatry, that
they shall be afraid of being defiled even by pronouncing the name of the idols.
The words are borrowed from Exod. xxiii. 13: &quot;Ye shall not make mention of the name
of other gods, neither shall it be heard out of thy mouth.&quot; The special expression
of the idea must, as a matter of course, be referred back to this idea itself, viz.,
the abhorrence of the former sin and, hence, such a mention cannot here be spoken
of as, like that in the passage before us, has no reference to that sin.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 20. &quot;<i>And I make a covenant for them in that day with the<!--inserted 1854 ed-->
beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping<!--inserted 1854 ed-->
things of the earth; and bow, and sword, and war I break out<!--inserted 1854 ed-->
of the land, and make them to dwell in safety.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span></p>
<p class="normal">On the expression, &quot;I make a covenant,&quot; <i>Manger</i> remarks,
&quot;The cause is here put for the effect, in order to inspire with greater security.&quot;
For the benefit of Israel, God makes a covenant with the beasts, <i>i.e.</i>, He
imposes upon them obligations not to injure them. The phrase
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span> is frequently used of a transaction
betwixt two parties, whereby an obligation is imposed upon only one of the parties,
without the assumption of any obligation by the other. A somewhat different turn
is given to the image in Job v. 23, where, by the mediation of God, the beasts themselves
enter into a covenant with Job after his restoration.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;</span> never means &quot;worm,&quot; but always &quot;what moves
and creeps,&quot; both small and great, as, in Ps. civ. 25, is subjoined by way of explanation.
The three classes stand in the same order in Gen. ix. 2. The normal order there
established, &quot;And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast,&quot;
etc., returns, after the removal of the disturbance which has been produced by sin.
Upon the words, &quot;I break,&quot; etc., <i>Manger</i> makes the very pertinent remark:
&quot;It is an emphatic and expressive brevity, according to which breaking out of the
land all instruments of war, and war itself, means that He will break them and remove
them out of the land.&quot; It is self-evident that &quot;war&quot; can here, as little as anywhere
else, mean &quot;weapons of war.&quot; The prophet, as it appears, had in view the passage
Lev. xxvi. 3 ff.: &quot;If ye will walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and
do them, I will give you your rains in due season, and the land shall yield her
increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.... And I give peace
in the land, and you dwell, and there is none who makes you afraid; and I destroy
the wild beasts out of the land, and the sword shall not enter into your land.&quot;
It is so much the more obvious that we ought to assume a reference to this passage,
as Ezekiel also, in xxxiv. 25 ff., copies it almost <i>verbatim</i>. On account
of the fatal <i>If</i>, that promise had hitherto been only very imperfectly fulfilled;
and frequently just the opposite of it had happened. But now that the condition
is fulfilled, the promise also shall be fully realized. But we must observe, with
reference to it, that, when we look to the present course of the world, this hope
remains always more or less ideal, because in reference to the condition also, the
idea is not yet reached by the reality. The idea is this:&mdash;As evil is, as a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>punishment, the inseparable concomitant of
sin, so prosperity and salvation are the inseparable companions of righteousness.
This is realized even in the present course of the world, in so far as everything
must serve to promote the prosperity of the righteous. But the full realization
belongs to the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#8055;&#945;</span>, where, along with
sin, evil too (which is <i>here</i> still necessary even for the righteous, in order
to purify them) shall be extirpated. Parallel are Is. ii. 4, xi.-xxxv. 9; Zech.
ix. 10.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 21. &quot;<i>And I betroth thee to Me for eternity; and I betroth
thee to Me in righteousness and judgment, and in loving-kindness and mercy.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 22. &quot;<i>And I betroth thee to Me in faithfulness, and thou
knowest the Lord.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1513;</span>, &quot;to espouse&quot;
(compare Deut. xx. 7, where it is contrasted with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;</span>), has reference to the entrance into a marriage entirely new, with the
wife of youth, and is, for this reason, chosen on purpose. &quot;Just as if (so <i>Calvin</i>
remarks) the people had never violated conjugal fidelity, God promises that they
should be His spouse, in the same manner as one marries a <i>virgo intacta</i>.&quot;
It was indeed a great mercy if the unfaithful wife was only received <i>again</i>.
Justly might she have been rejected for ever; for the only valid reason for a divorce
existed, inasmuch as she had lived in adultery for years. But God&#39;s mercy goes still
further. The old offences are not only <i>forgiven</i>, but <i>forgotten</i>. A
relation entirely new begins, into which there enter, on the one side, no suspicion
and no bitterness, and on the other, no painful recollections, such as may pass
into similar human relationships, where the consequences of sin never disappear
altogether, and where a painful remembrance always remains. The same dealing of
God is still repeated daily; every believer may still say with exultation: &quot;Old
things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot; It is the greatness
of this promise which occasions the direct address, whilst hitherto the Lord had
spoken of the wife in the third person. She shall hear face to face, the great word
out of His mouth, in order that she may be assured that it is she whom it concerns;
and in order to express its greatness, its joyfulness, and the difficulty of believing
it, it is repeated three times. <i>Calvin</i> says: &quot;Because it was difficult to
deliver the people from fear and despair, and because they could not but be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>aware how grievously they had sinned, and in
how many ways they had alienated themselves from God, it was necessary to employ
many consolations, that thus their faith might be confirmed. One likes to hear the
repetition of the intelligence of a great and unexpected good fortune which one
has some difficulty in realizing. And what could a man, despairing on account of
his sins, less readily realize than the greatest of all miracles&mdash;viz., that all
his sins should be done away with, at once and for ever? But the repetition is,
in this case, so much the more full of consolation, that, each time, it is accompanied
with the promise of some new blessing; that, each time, it opens up some new prospect
of new blessings from this new connection. First, there is the eternal duration,&mdash;then,
as a pledge of this, the attributes which God would display in bestowing it,&mdash;and,
finally, there are the blessings which He would impart to His betrothed.&quot; The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;</span> points back to the painful dissolution
of the former marriage-covenant: This new one shall not be liable to such a dissolution;
for &quot;the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall
not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed, saith the
Lord:&quot; Is. liv. 10. The attributes which God will display towards the wife, and
the conduct which she shall observe towards Him through His mercy, are connected
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1500;&#1497;</span>, &quot;I betroth thee to Me,&quot; by
means of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>, which is often used to mark the
circumstances on which some action rests. Thus, in the case before us, the betrothment
rests upon what God vouchsafes along with it, inasmuch as thereby only does it become
a true betrothment. That the accompanying gifts must be thus distributed&mdash;as we have
done&mdash;first, the faithful discharge of all the duties of a husband on His part, and
then, the inward communication of strength to her for the fulfilment of her obligations;
and that we are neither at liberty to refer, as do some interpreters, everything
to one of the two parties, nor to assume, as others do, that everything refers to
both at the same time&mdash;is proved not only by the intervening repetition of &quot;I betroth
thee to Me,&quot; but also by the internal nature of the gift&#39;s mentioned.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, &quot;mercy,&quot; cannot be spoken of in the
relation of the wife to God, nor knowledge of God, in the relation of God to the
wife. The four manifestations of God which are mentioned here form
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>a double pair,&mdash;righteousness and judgment,
loving-kindness and mercy. The two are frequently connected in a similar way; <i>
e.g.</i>, Is. i. 27: &quot;Zion shall be redeemed in judgment, and her inhabitants in
righteousness.&quot; They are distinguished thus:&mdash;the former,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;</span>, designates the <i>being just</i>, as
a subjective attribute, with the dispositions and actions flowing from it; the latter,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;</span>, denotes the <i>objective right</i>.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_271a" href="#ftn_271a">[1]</a></sup>
A man can give to another his right or judgment, and yet not be righteous; but God&#39;s
righteousness, and His doing right in reference to the Congregation, consists in
this:&mdash;that He faithfully performs the obligations which He took upon Himself when
He entered into covenant with her. This, however, is not sufficient. The obligations
entered into are reciprocal. If, then, the covenant be violated on the part of the
Congregation, what hope is left for her? In order the more to relieve and comfort
the wife, who, from former experience, knew full well what she might expect from
righteousness and judgment alone, the Lord adds a second pair,&mdash;loving-kindness and
mercy, the former being the root of the latter, and the latter being the form in
which the former manifests itself, in the relation of an omnipotent and holy God
to weak and sinful man. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;</span>, properly &quot;love,&quot;
man may also entertain towards God; although even this word is very rarely used
in reference to man, because God&#39;s love infinitely exceeds human love; but God only
can have <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, &quot;mercy,&quot; upon man. But still
a distressing thought might, and must be entertained by the wife. God&#39;s mercy and
love have their limits; they extend only to the one case which dissolves even human
marriage&mdash;the type of the heavenly marriage, the great mystery which the Apostle
refers to Christ and the Church. What, then, if this case should again occur? Her
heart, it is true, is now filled with pure love; but who knows whether this love
shall not cool,&mdash;whether she shall not again yield to temptation? A new consolation
is applied to the new distress. God Himself will bestow what it is not in the power
of man to bestow&mdash;viz., faithfulness towards Him (compare
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;</span> used of human faithfulness, in Hab.
ii. 4; Jer. v. 3, vii. 28; the faithfulness in this verse forms the contrast to
the whoredom in i. 2), <span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>and the knowledge of
Him. &quot;Thou knowest the Lord&quot; is tantamount to&mdash;&quot;in My knowledge.&quot; The knowledge of
God is here substantial knowledge. Whosoever thus knows God cannot but love Him,
and be faithful to Him. All idolatry, all sin, has its foundation in a want of the
knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 23. &quot;<i>And it comes to pass in that day, I will hear, saith
the Lord; I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</i> Ver. 24.
<i>And the earth shall hear the corn, and the must, and the oil; and they shall
hear Jezreel</i>&quot; (<i>i.e.</i>, him whom God sows).</p>
<p class="normal">The promise in this passage forms the contrast to the threatening
in Deut. xxviii. 23, 24: &quot;And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and
the earth that is under thee shall be iron. The Lord will give for the rain of thy
land, dust, and dust shall come down from heaven upon thee.&quot; The second
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;</span> is, by most interpreters, considered
as a resumption of the first. But we obtain a far more expressive sense, if we isolate
the first <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;</span>, &quot;I shall hear,&quot; namely, all
prayers which will be offered up unto Me by you, and for you. Parallel, among other
passages, is Is. lviii. 9, where the reformed people are promised: &quot;Then shalt thou
call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say. Here I am.&quot; By
a bold <i>prosopop&#339;ia</i>, the prophet makes heaven to pray that it might be permitted
to give to the earth that which is necessary for its fruitfulness, etc. Hitherto
they have been hindered from fulfilling their <i>destination</i>, since God was
obliged to withdraw His gifts from the unworthy people, ii. 11; but now, since this
obstacle has been removed, they pray for permission to resume their vocation. The
prophets in this manner give, as it were, a visible representation of the idea,
that there is in the whole world no good independent of God,&mdash;nothing which, in accordance
with its destination, is not ours, and would indeed be ours, if we stood in the
right relation to Him,&mdash;nothing that is not His, and that will not be taken away
from us, if we desire the gift without the Giver. <i>Calvin</i> remarks: &quot;The prophet
shows where and when the happiness of men begins, viz., when God adopts them, when
He betrothes Himself to them, after having put away their sins.... He teaches, also,
in these words, that the heavens do not become dry by some secret instinct; but
it is when God withholds His grace, that there is no rain by which the heavens water
the earth.&quot; God, then, here shows <span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>plainly that
the whole <i>order of nature</i> (as men are wont to say) is so entirely in His
hand, that not one drop of rain shall fall from heaven unless by His will,&mdash;that
the whole earth would produce no grass,&mdash;that, in short, all nature would be sterile,
unless He made it fruitful by His blessing.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 25. &quot;<i>And I sow her unto Me in the land, and I have mercy
upon her &#39;who had not obtained mercy&#39;</i> (Lo-Ruhamah); <i>and I say to &#39;not My
people&#39;</i> (Lo-Ammi), <i>Thou art My people, and they say to Me, My God.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The three symbolical names of the children of the prophet here
once more return. The <i>femin. suffix</i> in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;</span>,
referring to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;</span>, need not at all surprise
us; for, in the whole passage before us, the sign disappears in the thing signified.
In point of fact, however, <i>Jezreel</i> is equivalent to Israel to be sowed anew.
(It is not the Israel to be <i>planted</i> anew, which is a figure altogether different;
the sowing has always a reference to the increase.)</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The significant couple returns for a new reference&quot; (<i>Rückert</i>).
First, in vers. 1-3, the symbolical action is reported. At the command of the Lord,
the prophet takes a wife, who, notwithstanding his affectionate and faithful love,
lives in continued adultery. He does not entirely reject her; but, in order that
she may come to recovery and repentance, he puts her into a position where she must
abstain from her lovers. The interpretation of the symbol is given in ver. 4: Israel,
forsaken by the world, shall spend a long time in sad seclusion. A glance into the
more distant future, without any symbolical imagery, forms the conclusion. The punishment
will at length produce conversion. Israel returns to the Lord his God, and to David
his king.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>Then said the Lord unto me, Go again, love a</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span><i>woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress,
as the Lord loveth the sons of Israel, and they turn to other gods and love grape-cakes.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The right point of view for the interpretation of this verse has
been already, in many important respects, established; compare p. 183 sqq. We here
take for granted the results there obtained. It is of great importance, for an insight
into the whole passage, to remark, that the symbolical action in this section, just
as in that to which chap. i. belongs, embraces the entire relation of the Lord to
the people of Israel, and not, as some interpreters assume, one portion only, viz.,
the time from the beginning of the captivity. This false view&mdash;of which the futility
was first completely exposed by <i>Manger</i>&mdash;has arisen from the circumstance,
that the prophet, in narrating the execution of the divine commission, omits very
important events. In the expectation that every one would supply them, partly from
the commission itself, and partly from the preceding portions, where they had been
treated of with peculiar copiousness, he rather at once passes from the first conclusion
of the marriage, to that point which, in this passage, forms his main subject, namely,
the disciplinary punishment to which he subjects his wife,&mdash;the Lord, Israel. The
prophet&#39;s aim and purpose is to afford to the people a right view of the captivity
so near at hand; to lead them to consider it neither as a merely accidental event,
having, no connection at all with their sins; nor as a pure effect of divine anger,
aiming at their entire destruction; but rather as being at the same time a work
of punitive justice, and of corrective love. Between the second verse, &quot;I purchased
her to me,&quot; etc., and the third, &quot;Then I said unto her,&quot; etc., we must supply. And
I took her in marriage and loved her; but she committed adultery. That this is the
sound view, appears clearly from ver. 2. According to the right exposition (compare
p. 195 sqq.), this verse can be referred only to the first beginning of the relation
betwixt the Lord and the people of Israel&mdash;to that only by which He acquired the
right of property in this people, on delivering them from Egypt. This is confirmed,
moreover, by the second half of the verse under consideration: &quot;As the Lord loveth,&quot;
etc. Here the love of the Lord to Israel in its widest extent is spoken of. Every
limitation of it to a single manifestation&mdash;be it a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>renewal
of love after the apostasy, or the corrective discipline inflicted from love&mdash;is
quite arbitrary; and the more so, because, by the addition, &quot;And they turned,&quot; etc.,
the love of God is represented as running parallel with the apostasy of the people.
The same result is obtained from a consideration of the first half. For what entitles
us to explain &quot;love&quot; by &quot;love again,&quot; or even by &quot;<i>restitue amoris signa</i>&quot;
as is done by those who hold the opinion, already refuted, that the woman is <i>
Gomer</i>? The word &quot;love&quot; corresponds exactly with &quot;as the Lord loveth.&quot; If the
latter must be understood of the love of the Lord in its whole extent,&mdash;if it does
not designate merely the manifestation of love, but love itself,&mdash;how can a more
limited view be taken of the former &quot;love?&quot; How could we explain, as is done by
those who defend the reference to a new marriage, the words, &quot;Beloved of her friend,
and an adulteress,&quot; as referring to a former marriage of the wife, and as tantamount
to&mdash;who was beloved by her former husband, and yet committed adultery? In that case,
there would be the greatest dissimilarity betwixt the type and the antitype. Who,
in that case, is to be the type of the Lord? Is it to be the former husband, or
the prophet? If the figure is at all to correspond with the reality,&mdash;the first member
with the second, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</span> can be none other
than the prophet himself.&mdash;Let us now proceed to particulars,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;</span>, &quot;love,&quot; is stronger than
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1495;</span>, &quot;take,&quot; in chap. i. 2. There, marriage
only was spoken of; here, marriage from love and in love. This is still more emphatically
pointed out by the subsequent words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;</span>,
and contrasted with the conduct of the wife, which is indicated by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;&#1508;&#1514;</span>, so that the sense is this: &quot;In love
take a wife who, although she is beloved by thee, her friend, commits adultery,
and with whom&mdash;I tell it to thee beforehand&mdash;thou wilt live in a constant antagonism
of love, and of ingratitude, the grossest violation of love.&quot; The word &quot;<i>love</i>&quot;
has a reference to the love preceding and effecting the marriage; the word &quot;<i>beloved</i>,&quot;
to the love uninterruptedly continuing during the marriage, and notwithstanding
the continued adultery, unless we should say&mdash;and it is quite admissible&mdash;that &quot;love&quot;
implies, at the same time, &quot;to take out of love,&quot; and &quot;to love constantly.&quot; Instead
of &quot;beloved by <i>thee</i>&quot; it is said, &quot;beloved by her <i>friend</i>.&quot; Many have
been thereby misled; but it only serves to make the contrast more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span> prominent.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_276a" href="#ftn_276a">[1]</a></sup>
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</span> has only one signification&mdash;that of <i>
friend</i>. It never, by itself, means &quot;fellow-man,&quot; never &quot;fellow-Jew,&quot; never &quot;one
with whom we have intercourse.&quot; The Pharisees were quite correct in understanding
it as the opposite of enemy. In their gloss, Matt. v. 43,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#953;&#963;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#967;&#952;&#961;&#8057;&#957; &#963;&#959;&#965;</span>, there was one
thing only objectionable&mdash;the most important, it is true&mdash;that by the friend, they
understood only him whom their heart, void of love, loved indeed; not him whom they
ought to have loved, because God had united him to them by the sacred ties of friendship
and love. Thus, what ought to have awakened them to love, just served them as a
palliation for their hatred. Now this signification, which alone is the settled
one, is here also very suitable. He whom the wife criminally forsakes, is not a
severe husband, but her loving friend, whom she herself formerly acknowledged as
such, and who always remains the same. Entirely parallel is Jer. iii. 20: &quot;As a
wife is faithless towards her <i>friend</i>, so have ye been faithless to Me;&quot; compare
ver. 4: &quot;Hast thou not formerly called me. My father, <i>friend</i> of my youth
art thou?&quot; Compare also Song of Sol. v. 16. The correct meaning was long ago seen
by <i>Calvin</i>: &quot;There is,&quot; says he, &quot;an expressiveness in this word. For often,
when women prostitute themselves, they complain that they have done it on account
of the too great severity of their husbands, and that they are not treated by their
husbands with sufficient kindness. But if a husband delight in having his wife with
him, if he treat her kindly and perform the duties of a husband, she is then less
excusable. Hence, it is this most heinous ingratitude of the people that is here
expressed, and set in opposition to the infinite mercy and kindness of the Lord.&quot;
For a still better insight into the meaning of the first half of this verse, we
subjoin the <i>paraphrasis</i> by <i>Manger</i>: &quot;Seek thee a wife in whom thou
art to have thy delight, and whom thou art to treat with such love, that, even if
she, by her unfaithfulness, violate the sacred rights of matrimony, and thou, for
that reason, canst no longer live with her, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>she
shall still remain dear to thee, and shall be willingly received again into thy
favour, as soon as she shall have reformed her life.&quot;&mdash;In the second half of the
verse, there is a verbal agreement with passages of the Pentateuch, so close that
it cannot certainly be accidental. Compare on <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;
&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>, Deut. vii. 8, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;
&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;</span>,&mdash;an agreement which undoubtedly deserves so much more attention, that
we have already established the relationship of the passage with ver. 2. On
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, compare Deut. xxxi. 18:
&quot;I will hide My face in that day for all the evil they are doing, for they turn
to other gods,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;&mdash;.&#1508;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
&quot;grape-cakes,&quot; has, as to its substance, been already explained, p. 194 sqq. It
is the result of an entire misunderstanding, that some interpreters should here
think of the love of feasting and banqueting. Others (as <i>Gesenius</i>) are anxious
to prove that such cakes were used at the sacrifices which were offered to idols.
The grape-cakes are rather idolatry itself; but the expression, &quot;They love grape-cakes,&quot;
adds an essential feature to the words, &quot;They turn to other gods.&quot; It points, namely,
to the sinful origin of idolatry. Earnest and strict religion is substantial and
wholesome food; but idolatry is soft food, which is sought only by the dainty and
squeamish. That which is true of idolatry, is true also of the service of sin, and
of the world in general, which, in Job xx. 12, appears under the image of meat which
is, in the mouth, as sweet as honey from the comb, but which is, in the belly, changed
into the gall of asps. In the symbolism of the law, honey signified the <i>lust</i>
of the world; compare my work <i>Die Opfer der Heil. Schrift</i>, S. 44. It is only
the derivation of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;&#1497;&#1496;</span>, the signification
of which is sufficiently established by parallel passages, which requires investigation.
We have no hesitation in deriving it from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</span>,
&quot;fire;&quot; hence it means properly, &quot;that which has been subjected to fire (compare
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span>) = that which has been baked,&quot; &quot;cakes.&quot;
The derivation from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1513;</span>, &quot;to found,&quot; has of
late become current; but the objections to it are:&mdash;partly, that the transition from
&quot;founding,&quot; to &quot;cake,&quot; is by no means an easy one; partly and mainly, that there
is not the slightest trace of this root elsewhere in Hebrew. It is asserted, indeed,
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;</span> itself is found in Is. xvi. 7,
with a signification which renders necessary the derivation from the verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1513;</span>. But, even in that passage, the signification
of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>&quot;cakes&quot; must be retained. The following
reasons are in favour of it, and against the signification &quot;ruins,&quot; adopted by
<i>Gesenius</i>, <i>Winer</i>, and <i>Hitzig</i>. 1. The signification &quot;cakes&quot; deserves,
<i>ceteris paribus</i>, a decided preference, because it is established by the other
passages. It is only for reasons the most cogent that we can grant that one and
the same word has two meanings, and these not at all connected with each other.
2. The transition from the meaning &quot;foundation,&quot; which alone can be derived from
the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1513;</span>, to that of &quot;<i>ruins</i>,&quot; is
by no means so easy as those critics would represent it. With respect to a rebuilding,
for which the ruins&#39; afford the foundation, they might, it is true, be called foundations,
compare Is. lviii. 12, but not where destruction only is concerned. Who would speak
of howling over foundations, instead of howling over ruins? 3. The context is quite
decisive. If we translate <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;</span> by &quot;ruins,&quot;
the subsequent <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> is quite inexplicable. This
little word, upon which so much depends, performs also the office of a guide: &quot;For
this reason Moab howls, for Moab altogether does he howl, for the cakes of Kirhareseth
you do sigh, wholly afflicted; <i>for</i> the vineyards of Heshbon are withered,
the vine of Sibmah, the grapes of which intoxicated the lord of the nations,&quot; etc.
Then, ver. 9, &quot;Therefore I weep with Jaeser for the vine of Sibmah.&quot; If there be
no more grapes, neither are there any more grape-cakes. The destruction of the vineyards
is therefore the cause of the howling for the cakes. That such cakes, moreover,
were prepared in many places in Moab, sufficiently appears from the name of the
place Dibhlathaim, <i>i.e.</i>, town of cakes. It may be remarked further, that
we are not entitled to assume a sing. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;</span>
as given by lexicographers along with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; ;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;&#1492;</span>
likewise forms the plural <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span>.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver,
and a homer of barley, and a lethech of barley.</i>&quot; Compare the explanation of
this verse, p. 195 sqq.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And I said unto her. Thou art to sit for me many days:
thou art not to whore, and thou art not to belong to a man; and so I also to thee.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The sitting has the accessory idea of being forsaken and solitary,
which may be explained from the circumstance, that he who is not invited to go with
us is left to sit. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, Gen. xxxviii. 11: &quot;Sit as a widow in thy fathers
house, until Shelah <span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>my son be grown;&quot; Is. xlvii.
8, where Babylon says, &quot;I shall not <i>sit</i> as a widow,&quot; etc. The Fut. in this
and the following verses must not be taken in an imperative sense, as meaning, thou
shalt sit for me, thou shalt not whore; the explanation given in ver. 4, and in
the parallel passage in chap. ii. 8, 9, are alike opposed to it. The husband will
not subject his wife to a moral probation, but he will lock her up, so that she
must <i>sit</i> solitary, and <i>cannot</i> whore. With reference to this. <i>Manger</i>
strikingly remarks: &quot;There is, in that very severity, the beginning of leniency;
&#39;sit for me,&#39; <i>i.e.</i>, I who have been so unworthily treated by thee, and who
yet am thy most affectionate husband, and who, though now at a distance from thee,
will not altogether forget thee.&quot; The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1497;</span> indicates
that the sitting of the wife must have reference to the prophet. Quite similar is
Exod. xxiv. 14: &quot;And he said unto the elders, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1489;&#1493;
&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;</span>, Sit ye here for us until we return to you.&quot; The phrase itself, which
must not be explained by &quot;to sit in expectation of some one,&quot; does not indicate
in what way the sitting has reference to him. The issue of the whole proceeding,
described in ver. 5, clearly shows, however, that it is not inflicted by him as
a merited punishment, as an effect of his just indignation, but rather that we must
think chiefly of his compassionate love, which makes use of these means in order
to render the reunion possible.&mdash;The distinction between &quot;to whore,&quot; and &quot;to belong
to a man,&quot; is obvious: the former denotes <i>vagos et promiscuus amores</i>; the
other, connubial connection with a single individual; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Ezek.
xvi. 8; Lev. xxi. 3. But the question is,&mdash;Who is to be understood by the &quot;<i>man?</i>&quot;
Several refer it to the prophet exclusively. Thus <i>Jerome</i> says, &quot;Thou shalt
not shamefully prostitute thyself with other lovers, nor be legally connected with
me, the man to whom thou art married.&quot; Others admit, at least, a co-reference to
the prophet = the Lord. By the words, &quot;Thou art not to whore,&quot; they say that the
intercourse with the lovers is excluded; but, by, &quot;Thou art not to belong to a man,&quot;
the intercourse with the husband also; so that the sense would be, &quot;Thou shalt not
have connubial intercourse either with me, or with any other man.&quot; But the correct
view is to refer both to the intercourse with the lovers; and so, indeed, that the
former designates the giving of herself up, now to one, then to another; while the
latter points to her entering <span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span>into a firm relation
to a single individual; just as, in point of fact, the relation of Israel to the
idols hitherto was a whoring. According as it suited their inclination, they made,
now this, and then that, god of the neighbouring nations an object of their worship;
whilst a marriage connection would have been formed, if they had entered with any
one of them into a permanent and exclusive connection, similar to that which had
heretofore existed between them and the Lord. This explanation is required by the
words, &quot;And so I also to thee,&quot; at the close of the verse. If the words, &quot;Thou shalt
not belong to any man,&quot; referred to the prophet, then &quot;thou shalt not have any intercourse
with me&quot; would imply, &quot;I shall not have any intercourse with thee;&quot; and did not
require any new mention to be made.&mdash;The questions, however, now arise:&mdash;By what means
was the state of things corresponding to the figure to be brought about? By what
is adulterous Israel to be prevented from whoring, and from belonging to any man?
By what means is idolatry to be extirpated from among the people? The answer has
been already given in our remarks on chap. ii. 8, 9. The idols manifest themselves
to Israel in their supposed gifts. If these were taken from them,&mdash;if they were entirely
stripped, and plunged into want and misery, they could not fail to recognise the
vanity of all their previous efforts, along with the vanity of the object of their
worship, while their love to him could not but vanish. The absolute inability of
the idols to afford consolation and help to the people in their sufferings must
have put an end to their showing them allegiance.&mdash;The last words, &quot;And I also to
thee,&quot; are explained by the greater number of interpreters to mean, &quot;I also will
be thine.&quot; <i>Manger</i> explains them thus: &quot;I will not altogether break the tie
of our love, nor marry another wife; but I will remain thine, will at last receive
thee again into my favour, and restore thee to the position of my wife.&quot; <i>De Wette</i>
interprets them thus: &quot;But then I will come to thee;&quot; <i>Umbreit</i>: &quot;And I also
only to thee;&quot; <i>Ewald</i>: &quot;And yet I am full of love towards thee.&quot; But the words,
&quot;And I also to thee,&quot; are rather tantamount to&mdash;&quot;I will conduct myself in a similar
manner towards thee.&quot; Now two things may constitute this equality of conduct. <i>
Either</i> it is conceived thus:&mdash;that the prophet is placed in parallelism with
the wife. The latter has lost all claims upon the prophet; she has violated connubial
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>fidelity, and, hence, has no title to demand
that he should observe it. But that which she cannot demand from him, he does, from
the necessity of his nature. He promises to her that, during the proceeding which
has commenced against her, he would not enter into any new connection; and by holding
out to her the hope of her returning, at some future period, to her old relation
to him, he makes it more easy for her to break off the sinful connections which
have destroyed it. Without a figure: The Lord, from His forbearance and mercy, waits
for the reformation of those who hitherto were His people; does not drive them to
despair by receiving another people in their place. <i>Or</i>, The prophet is placed
in parallelism with the other man. As the wife does not enter into any relation
with that man, so the prophet also abstains from any nearer intercourse with her.
The latter explanation (adopted by <i>Simson</i> and <i>Hitzig</i>) is to be preferred.
The exclusiveness cannot in the same sense be applicable to the prophet, representing
the Lord, as to the wife, representing the people. So early as in Deut. xxxii. 21,
we read: &quot;They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked
Me to anger with their vanities; and I will move them to jealousy with those which
are not a people, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation,&quot; After all
that had, in the Song of Solomon, been predicted regarding the reception of the
Gentile nations into the kingdom of God and Christ, and about the receiving again
into it of Israel, to be effected by their instrumentality (compare my <i>Comment.
on Song of Sol.</i>, S. 239), the thought suggested by the former view would be
quite incomprehensible. Quite decisive, however, is ver. 4, in which the thought,
which is here in a symbolical garb, is expressed in plain language. There, however,
not only the intercourse with the idols, but the connection with Jehovah also, appears
to be intermitted. The reason why the prophet does not enter into a closer connection
with the wife is, that her repentance is more of a negative, than of a positive
character. By want and isolation, her hard heart is to be broken, true repentance
to be called forth, and the flame of cordial conversion and love to her husband,
whose faithful love she had so ill requited, to be enkindled in her. In favour of
the explanation given by us, and in opposition to that first mentioned, the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1501;</span> is decisive. Against this, that other explanation,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>in its various modifications, tries its strength
in vain. &quot;I also will be thine, or will adhere to thee,&quot; would require in the preceding
context, &quot;Thou shalt be mine, or adhere to me;&quot; but of this, there is no trace.
It is only in ver. 5 that, with an <i>after</i>, the conversion is reported. In
favour of that false interpretation it is said, and with some plausibility, that
the explanation would otherwise be more extended than the symbol: The latter would
contain the outward dealing only; while the former, in ver. 5, would contain at
the same time its salutary effect. But, even according to this explanation, the
words would not correspond with ver. 5. <i>Here</i>, the showing of mercy would
be announced without the mention, even by a word, of the sincere return to the husband&mdash;and
this, altogether apart from the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1501;</span>, would
be quite unsuitable, and would, moreover, be opposed by the analogy of chap. ii.
9&mdash;while, in ver. 5, not the showing of mercy, but only the reformation, would form
the subject. In that case, it ought not to have been said, &quot;They shall return to
the Lord,&quot; but rather, &quot;The Lord shall return to them.&quot; But this plausible reason
falls to the ground, along with the unfounded supposition that the two last verses
contain the explanation. The correct view is, that the explanation is limited to
ver. 4. Ver. 5 must be considered as an appendix, in which, without any figurative
covering, the effect is described which will be produced upon the nation by these
outward dealings. The symbol and its explanation extend only as far as the main
object of the prophet in the section under review,&mdash;that object being to present
the impending captivity in its true light, and thereby to secure against levity
and despair when it should appear.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>For many days the children of Israel shall sit without
a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without a pillar, and
without an Ephod and Teraphim.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> is used because the reason
of the performance of the symbolical action lies in its signification. Concerning
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1489;</span>, see the remarks on ver. 3; compare, moreover.
Lament, i. 1: &quot;How does the city sit solitary that was full of people! she has become
as a widow.&quot;&mdash;The question is, whether, by the religious objects here mentioned,
such only are to be understood as belonged to the worship of the idols, or such
also as belonged to the worship of Jehovah. The following furnishes the reply. The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1492;</span> only <span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>can
be considered as belonging exclusively to the idolatrous worship. Such pillars always
occur only as being consecrated to the idols&mdash;especially to Baal. It cannot be proved
in any way that, contrary to the express command in Lev. xxvi. 1, Deut. xvi. 22,
they were, in the kingdom of Israel, consecrated to the Lord also; compare 2 Kings
iii. 2, xvii. 10, x. 26-28. On the other hand, among the objects mentioned, there
is also one, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491;</span>, the mantle for the
shoulders of the high priest, on which the Urim and Thummim were placed, which must
be considered as belonging exclusively to the worship of Jehovah; at least there
is not the smallest trace to be found that it was part of any idolatrous worship.
It is true that <i>Gesenius</i>, in the <i>Thesaurus</i>, p. 135, gives <i>s. v.</i>
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491;</span>, under 2, the signification <i>statua</i>,
<i>simulacrum idoli</i>, and, besides the passages under consideration, refers to
Jud. viii. 27, xvii. 5, xviii. 14, 17. But one requires only to examine these passages
a little more minutely, to be convinced that the metamorphosis of Jehovah into an
idol is as little justified as the changing of the mantle into a statue. From the
personal character of Gideon, who was so zealous for the Lord against the idols,
we cannot at all think of idolatry in Jud. viii. 27. In the <i>Dissertations on
the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>, vol. ii. p. 80, it has been proved that the
Ephod of Gideon was a precious imitation of that of the high priest. In chap. xvii.
5, we need only to consider these words: &quot;And the man Micah had an house of God,
and made an Ephod and Teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, and he became a
priest to him.&quot; Afterwards, Micah took a <i>Levite</i> for a priest. But for what
reason should he have been better suited for that purpose than any other man? The
answer is given in ver. 13: &quot;Then said Micah, Now I know that Jehovah will do me
good, for the Levite has become a priest to me.&quot; The ignorant man knows after all
thus much, that the Levites alone are the only legitimate servants of Jehovah, and
he rejoices, therefore, that he had now remedied the former irregularity. Jud. xviii.
14 does not require any particular illustration, for it is the same Ephod which
is spoken of in that passage; but we must still direct attention to vers. 5 and
6 of that chapter. &quot;Then they (the Danites) said unto him (the Levite), Ask God,
we pray thee, in order that we may know whether our way in which we go shall be
prosperous. And the priest said unto them, Go in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>peace,
before <i>Jehovah</i> is the way wherein ye go.&quot; Here, then, we have a revelation
given to the priest, as is alleged, by means of Ephod and Teraphim; and this revelation
is not ascribed to the idols, but to Jehovah, whom alone the Levite wished to serve.
From this it appeal&#39;s that the graven image and the molten image&mdash;which, besides
Ephod and Teraphim, according to ver. 14, exist in the house of Micah&mdash;must be considered
as representations of Jehovah, similar to the calves in the kingdom of the ten tribes.
In vol. ii. pp. 78, 79, of my <i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,
it has been demonstrated that the Ephod of Micah was, along with the Teraphim, an
apeing of the high-priestly Ephod with the Urim and Thummim. The four objects mentioned
in Judges xvii. and xviii. are such as were separable although connected, and connected
although separable. The <i>molten work</i> is the pedestal under the image; the
image is clothed with the Ephod, and in the Ephod were the Teraphim, from whom information
and good counsel for the future were expected. For, that this is the object of the
whole contrivance, is plain from chap. xviii. 5, 6, where the priest asks counsel
of God for the Danites.&mdash;With regard to the other two objects mentioned in the verse
before us, viz., the sacrifice and Teraphim, a reference, at least exclusive, to
idolatrous worship, cannot be by any means maintained. As sacrifices are mentioned
in the widest generality, without any limitation in the preceding context, there
is certainly nothing which could in the least entitle us to exclude the sacrifices
which were offered to Jehovah. The Teraphim are intermediate deities, by means of
which the future is to be disclosed (compare the remarks on Zech. x. 2); they might
be brought into connection with every religious system, but are found only once
in connection with any other religion than that of Jehovah,&mdash;and this in a case where
a non-Israelite is spoken of. It is true, however, that, in substance, the Teraphim
belong to the side of idolatry; for, wherever they occur within the religion of
Jehovah, they belong to a degenerate condition of it only, which is on a par with
idolatry. It would appear that they are here contrasted with the Ephod, as the illegal
means for ascertaining the future, in opposition to the legal means. That the Ephod
was used for discovering the divine will, is seen from 1 Sam. xxiii. 9, xxx. 7.
The Teraphim, in like manner, served to explore <span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>the
future. A closer connection of the two seems to be indicated by the circumstance
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;</span> is omitted before
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;</span>.&mdash;But how can we account for this strange
intermingling of what belonged to the idols with what belonged to Jehovah, since
it cannot but be done intentionally? It points to the dark mixture which at that
time existed among the people, and is a kind of ironical reflection upon it.&mdash;The
Lord makes them disgusted with idolatry, and all that belongs to it, through His
visitations, in which they seek in vain the help of the idols, and become thoroughly
acquainted with their vanity; compare remarks in ver. 3. At the same time, however,
all the pledges of His grace are taken from them, so that they get into an altogether
isolated position. He withdraws from them their independent government, the altar
and priesthood&mdash;the former as a just punishment for their rebellion against the dynasty
ordained by God (compare chap. viii. 4), of which, first Israel, and then Judah,
had made themselves guilty.&mdash;As regards the historical reference of this prophecy,
interpreters are divided, and refer it either to the Assyrian, the Babylonish, or
the Romish exile. The greater number of them, however, refer it exclusively to the
last. This is especially the case with the Jewish interpreters; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>
Kimchi</i>, who says: &quot;These are the days of the exile, in which we are now; we
have neither an Israelitish king nor an Israelitish prince, but are under the dominion
of the Gentiles and their kings.&quot; The principal defenders of a direct reference
to the Assyrian captivity, are <i>Venema</i> (<i>Dissert.</i> p. 232) and <i>Manger</i>.
The decision depends chiefly upon what we are to understand by &quot;the children of
Israel.&quot; If these are the whole people, it is arbitrary to assign any narrower limits
to the <i>Word</i> of God, than to His <i>deed</i>. The prophecy must, in that case,
comprehend everything in which the idea is realized; and this so much the more,
as the spiritual eye of the prophet, directed to the idea only, does not generally
regard the intervals which, in the fulfilment, lie between the various realizations
of the <i>idea</i>. But now, ver. 5 would seem to lead us to entertain the opinion,
that, in the first instance, the prophet has in view the children of Israel in the
more limited sense only. The words, &quot;They shall return and seek David their king,&quot;
imply a reference to the then existing apostasy of the ten tribes from the dynasty
of David. But the future apostasy of the sons of Judah also from
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>David their king may be as well <i>presupposed</i>
here, as, in chapter ii. 2, their being carried away; and this so much the rather,
as in chap. ii. 2, the words, &quot;They appoint themselves a king,&quot; suggest that the
sons of Judah also, no less than the sons of Israel, are without a head, and hence
have apostatized from David the king. And it is so much the more natural to adopt
such a supposition, as the Song of Solomon had already described so minutely the
rebellion of the whole people against the glorious descendant of David&mdash;the heavenly
Solomon&mdash;to which the apostasy of the ten tribes from the house of David was only
a prelude. Considering the whole relation in which Hosea stands to the Song of Solomon,
we could scarcely imagine that, in this respect, he should not have alluded to,
and resumed its contents. <i>In the whole third chapter there is nothing which refers
exclusively to the ten tribes.</i> Chap. iii. 2 has reference to all Israel. Throughout
the whole Book of Hosea also, as well as by the second Israelitish prophet Amos
(compare the remarks on Amos, chap ix.), Judah and Israel are viewed together, both
as regards apostasy and punishment (v. 5, 12, viii. 14, x. 11, etc.), and as regards
salvation, vi. 1-4, etc. Of special importance is the comparison of the remarkable
prophecy of Azariah in 2 Chron. xv. 2-4, which was uttered at the time of Asa, king
of Judah, and which so nearly coincides with the one before us, that the idea suggests
itself of an allusion to it by Hosea: &quot;Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin:
The Lord will be with you, if you are with Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found
of you; and if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you. And many days will be to Israel
when there is no true God,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_286a" href="#ftn_286a">[2]</a></sup>
and no teaching priest,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_286b" href="#ftn_286b">[3]</a></sup>
and no law. Then they return in their trouble unto Jehovah the God of Israel, and
they seek Him, and He is found of them.&quot; If the fundamental prophecy refer to all
Israel, the same must be the case with the prophecy under consideration. The condition
in which the Jews are, up to the present day, is described in both of these prophecies
with remarkable clearness; and hence we may most confidently entertain
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>the hope, that there shall be a fulfilment
also of that which, in them as well as in the Song of Solomon, has been foretold
regarding the glorious issue of these dealings of God.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>Afterwards shall the children of Israel return and
seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and shall tremble to the Lord and
to His goodness in the end of the days.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> must not by any
means be regarded as modifying <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1493;</span>, so that
both the verbs would constitute only one verbal idea. This must be objected to,
not only from the arguments already stated in the remarks on chap. ii. 11, but,
most decidedly, on account of the parallel passage, chap. ii. 9, &quot;I will go and
return to my first husband.&quot; Compare chap. vi. 1: &quot;Come and let us return unto the
Lord;&quot; v. 15, where the Lord says, &quot;I will go and return to My place until they
become guilty and seek My face; in their affliction they will seek Me;&quot; Jer. l.
4: &quot;In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall
<i>come</i>, they and the children of Judah together, weeping will they come, and
seek the Lord their God,&quot;&mdash;a passage which, like Jer. xxx. 9, points to the one before
us in a manner not to be mistaken; Is. x. 21: &quot;The remnant shall <i>return</i>,
the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.&quot; The text, and the parallel passages,
most clearly indicate what is to be considered as the object of their return, namely,
the Lord their God, and David their king, from whom they had so shamefully apostatized;
so that those interpreters who here think of a return to Canaan do not deserve a
refutation. The words, &quot;Jehovah their God,&quot; at the same time lay open the delusion
of the Israelites (who imagined that they could still possess the true God, in the
idol which they called Jehovah), and rebuke their ingratitude. <i>Calvin</i> says,
&quot;God had offered Himself to them, yea. He had had familiar intercourse with them,&mdash;He
had, as it were, brought them up on His bosom just as a father does his sons. The
prophet, therefore, indirectly rebukes, in these words, their stupendous wickedness.&quot;
The God of the Israelites, as well as the God of the Jews after they had rejected
Christ, stood to the God of Israel in the same relation as does the God of the Deists
and Rationalists to the God of the Christians. The question here arises. Who is
to be understood here by &quot;David their king?&quot; Some interpreters refer it, after the
example of <i>Theodoret</i> (t. ii. p. 2, p. 1326), to <span class="pagenum">[Pg
288]</span>Zerubbabel: but by far the greater number of them, following the Chaldee
(&quot;And they shall obey the Messiah, the son of David their king&quot;), understand, thereby,
the Messiah. It is true that the latter exposition is quite correct as to its substance,
but not as to the form in which it is commonly expressed. From the words, &quot;They
shall return and seek,&quot; it is evident that the Messiah is here not called David
as an individual, as is done in other passages, <i>e.g.</i>, Jer. xxx. 9. For the
return presupposes their having been there formerly, and their having departed;
just as the seeking implies neglecting. The expression, &quot;their king,&quot; also requires
special attention. In contrast to the &quot;king&quot; in ver. 4 (compare viii. 4, &quot;They have
made a king, and not by Me, a prince, and I knew it not&quot;), it shows that the subject
of discourse is not by any means a new king to be elected, but such an one as the
Israelites ought to obey, even now, as the king ordained for them by God. The sound
view is this: By the &quot;king David&quot; the whole Davidic house is to be understood, which
is here to be considered as an unity, in the same manner as is done in 2 Sam. vii.,
and in a whole series of Psalms which celebrate the mercies shown, and to be shown,
to David and his house.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_288a" href="#ftn_288a">[4]</a></sup>
These mercies are most fully concentrated in Christ, in whose appearance and everlasting
dominion the promises given to David were first to be fully realized. The prophet
mentions the whole&mdash;the Davidic family&mdash;because it was only thus that the contrast
between the apostasy and the return could be fully brought out; but that, in so
doing, he has Christ especially in view&mdash;that he expected a return of the children
of Israel to David in Christ, is shown by the term
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, which, in the prophets, never
occurs in any other sense than the times of the Messiah. (Compare, regarding this
expression, the remarks on Amos ix. 1.) This reason is alone sufficient to refute
the reference to Zerubbabel; although so much must indeed be conceded, that the
circumstance of part of the citizens of the kingdom of the ten tribes adhering to
him, the descendant of the house of David, may be considered as a prelude of that
general return. The close connection betwixt the seeking of Jehovah their God and
David their king, likewise claims our attention. David and his family had been elected
by God to be the mediator between Him and the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>people&mdash;the
channel through which all His blessings flowed clown upon the people&mdash;the visible
image of the invisible King, who, at the end of the days, was, in Christ, most perfectly
to reflect His glory. The Israelites, in turning away from David their king, turned
away, at the same time, from Jehovah their God,&mdash;as was but too soon manifested by
the other signs of apostasy from Him, by the introduction of the worship of calves,
etc. He who refuses to acknowledge God in that which He has Himself declared to
be His visible image (from Christ down to every relation which represents Him in
any respect, <i>e.g.</i>, that of the father to the son, of the king to the subject),
will soon cease to acknowledge Himself. But as, first, the ten tribes, and afterwards,
the entire people, apostatized from God, by apostatizing from David, so, by their
apostasy from him, they excluded themselves from all participation in the privileges
of the people of God, which could flow to them only through him. It is only when
they return to David by returning to Christ, that, from their self-made God, they
come to the true God, and within the sphere of His blessings. That the same thing
is repeated among ourselves in the case of those who have forsaken Christ their
King, and yet imagine still to possess God, and that it is only by their returning
to the brightness of His glory that they can attain to a true union with the Lord
their God, and to a participation in the blessings which He bestows,&mdash;all this is
so obvious as to require nothing beyond a simple suggestion. A perfectly sound interpretation
of this passage is to be found in <i>Calvin</i>, who remarks: &quot;David was, as it
were, a messenger of the Lord, and, hence, that defection of the ten tribes was
tantamount to a rejection of the living God. The Lord had, on a former occasion,
said to Samuel (1 Sam. viii. 7), &#39;They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected
Me.&#39; But how much more was this applicable in the case of David, whom Samuel had
anointed at the command of God, and whom the Lord had adorned with so many glorious
attributes, that they could not reject his rule without, at the same time, publicly
rejecting, to a certain extent, the Lord Himself! It is true, indeed, that David
was then dead; but Hosea here represents, in his person, his everlasting dominion,
which the Jews knew would last as long as the sun and moon.&quot; The expression,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>&quot;They tremble to the Lord,&quot; graphically describes
the disposition of heart in him, who, trembling with terror and anxiety on account
of the surrounding danger and distress, flees to Him who can alone afford help and
deliverance. That we must thus explain it,&mdash;that we cannot entertain the idea of
any trembling which proceeds from the inconceivable greatness of the blessing&mdash;a
disposition of heart so graphically described by <i>Claudian</i> in the words,</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="continue">&quot;Horret adhuc animus, manifestaque gaudia differt <br>
	Dum stupet et tanto cunctatur credere voto,&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continue">and that we can as little think of a fearing or trembling which
is the consequence of the knowledge of deep sinfulness and unworthiness, is shown
by the parallel passage in chap. xi. 11: &quot;They tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and
as a dove out of the land of Assyria.&quot; The bird and the dove are here an emblem
of helplessness. Substantially parallel is also chap. v. 15: &quot;In their affliction
they will seek Me.&quot; Their trembling is not voluntary; it is forced upon them by
the Lord. But that they tremble <i>to the Lord</i>&mdash;that, through fear, they suffer
themselves to be led to the Lord&mdash;is their free act, although possible only by the
assistance of grace. The manner in which the words, &quot;and to His goodness,&quot; are to
be understood, is most plainly shown by the words, &quot;I will return to my first husband,
for it was <i>better</i> with me then than now,&quot; chap. ii. 9. Along with the Lord,
they have lost His goodness also, and the gifts flowing from it. But distress again
drives them to seek the Lord, and His goodness, which is inseparable from Himself.
This explanation is confirmed by other parallel passages also; <i>e.g.</i>, Jer.
xxxi. 12: &quot;And they come and exult on the height of Zion, and flow together to the
goodness of the Lord (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>), to corn,
and must, and oil, and lambs, and cattle;&quot; ver. 14: &quot;My people shall be satisfied
with My goodness.&quot; Compare also Ps. xxvii. 13, xxxi. 20; Zech. ix. 17. We would
therefore object to the opinion of several interpreters, who would explain
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> as being equivalent to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>, to His manifestation in the Angel

<h2><a name="div2_291" href="#div2Ref_291">THE PROPHET JOEL</a></h2>
<h3><a name="div3_291" href="#div3Ref_291">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The position which has been assigned to Joel in the collection
of the Minor Prophets, furnishes an external argument for the determination of the
time at which Joel wrote. There cannot be any doubt that the Collectors were guided
by a consideration of the chronology. The circumstance, that they placed the prophecies
of Joel just between the two prophets who, according to the inscriptions and contents
of their prophecies, belonged to the time of Jeroboam and Uzziah, is thus equivalent
to an express testimony that he also lived, and exercised his ministry, during that
time.</p>
<p class="normal">By this testimony we have, in the meanwhile, obtained a firm standing-point;
and it must remain firm, as long as it is not overthrown by other unquestionable
facts, and the Collectors are not convicted of an historical error. But, as regards
the latter point, there is the greater room for caution, because all the other statements
which they have made are, upon a careful examination, found to stand the test; for
none of the other Minor Prophets is found to occupy a place to which he is not entitled.
But no such facts are to be found; on the contrary, everything serves to confirm
their testimony.</p>
<p class="normal">It will not be possible to assign the prophecies of Joel to a
later period; for Amos places at the head of one of his prophecies one of the utterances
of Joel (compare Amos i. 2 with Joel iv. 16 [iii. 16]), as the text, as it were,
on which he is to comment. That we are not thereby precluded from considering the
two prophets as contemporaneous, is shown by the altogether similar case of Isaiah,
in his relation to Micah. Isaiah, too, borrows, in chap. xiii. 6, a sentence from
Joel i. 15, the peculiarity of which proves that the coincidence is not accidental.
Such verbal repetitions must not be, by any means, considered as unintentional reminiscences.
They served to exhibit that the prophets acknowledged one another as the organs
of the Holy Spirit,&mdash;to testify the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8134; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>,
the want of which in the times after Ezra and Nehemiah is mentioned by Josephus
as one of the reasons why none of the writings of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>that
period could be acknowledged as sacred. (See the Author&#39;s <i>Dissertations on the
Genuineness of Daniel</i>, p. 199.) <i>Further</i>,&mdash;The description of the threatening
judgment in chap. i. and ii. is, in Joel, kept just in that very same generality
in which we find it in the oldest prophecies that have been preserved to us, viz.,
in Amos, in the first chapters of Isaiah and of Hosea; whilst in later times, the
threatening is, throughout, particularized by the express mention of the instruments
who were, in the first instance, to serve for its fulfilment, viz., the Assyrians
and Babylonians. That which Judah had to suffer from the former was so severe, that
Joel, in chap. iv. 4 ff.&mdash;where he mentions, although, as it were, only in the way
of example, nations with which Judah had hitherto already come into hostile contact&mdash;would
scarcely have passed them over in silence, in order to mention only the far lesser
calamity inflicted by other nations.</p>
<p class="normal">But just as little can we think of an earlier period. It is certainly
not accidental, that among all the prophets whose writings have been preserved to
us, no one appeared at an earlier period; any more than it is accidental, that no
prophecies are extant of the distinguished men of God in earlier times, of whom
the historical books make mention, especially Elijah and Elisha. It was only when
the great divine judgments were being prepared, and were approaching, that it was
time, through their announcement, to waken from the slumber of security those who
had forgotten God, and to open the treasures of hope and consolation to the faithful.
Formerly, the living, oral word of the prophets was the principal thing; but now
that God opened up to them a wider view,&mdash;that their calling had regard not only
to the present, but also to the future time, the written word was raised to an equal
dignity. Nothing, then, but the most cogent reasons could induce us to make, in
the case of Joel only, an exception to so established a rule.</p>
<p class="normal">But we cannot acknowledge as such, what <i>Credner</i> (in his
<i>Comment. on Joel</i>, p. 41 sqq.) has brought forward to prove that Joel committed
to writing his prophecies as early as under the reign of Joash, <i>i.e.</i>, about
870-65 B.C., or from seventy to eighty years earlier than any of the other prophecies
which have come down to us. If we do not allow ourselves to be carried away by the
multitude of his words, we shall find that the only remaining plausible argument
is&mdash;that the Syrians of Damascus <span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span>are not mentioned
among the enemies of the Covenant-people, as they are in Amos. From this, <i>Credner</i>
infers that Joel must have prophesied before the first inroad of the Syrians on
Judea, which, according to 2 Kings xii. 18 ff.; 2 Chron. xxiv. 23 ff., took place
under Jehoash. But we need only look at that passage, in order to be convinced that
the mention of that event could not be expected in Joel. The expedition of the Syrians
was not directed against Judea, but against the Philistines. It was only a single
detached corps which, according to Chronicles, incidentally, and on their return,
made an inroad on Judah; but Jerusalem itself was not taken. This single act of
hostility could not but be soon forgotten in the course of time. It was of quite
a different character from that of the Ph&#339;nicians and Philistines mentioned by Joel,
which were only particular outbreaks of the hatred and envy which they continually
cherished against the Covenant-people, and which, as such, were preeminently the
object of punitive divine justice. But on what ground does the supposition rest,
that Joel must necessarily mention all those nations, with which the Covenant-people
came, at any time, into hostile contact? The context certainly does not favour such
an idea. The mention of former hostile attacks in chap. iv. (iii.) 4-8 is altogether
incidental, as <i>Vitringa</i>, in his <i>Typ. Doctr. Proph.</i> p. 189 sqq., has
admitted: &quot;The prophet,&quot; says he, &quot;was describing the heavy judgments with which
God would, after the effusion of the Spirit, successively, and especially in the
latter days, visit the enemies of the Church, and overthrow them, on account of
the injuries which they had inflicted upon it. And while he was doing so, those
injuries presented themselves to his mind, which in his own time, and in the immediate
past, were inflicted upon the Jewish people&mdash;a portion of the universal Church&mdash;by
the neighbouring nations, the Tyrians, Sidonians, and Philistines. To them he addresses
his discourse <i>in passing</i> (<i>in transitu</i>), and announces to them, in
the name of God, that they themselves also would not remain unpunished.&quot; The correctness
of <i>Vitringa</i>, with his &quot;<i>in transitu</i>,&quot; is proved by the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1490;&#1501;</span>, as well as by the circumstance, that
vers. 9 ff. are closely connected with ver. 3; so that vers. 4 ff. form a real parenthesis.
How entirely out of place would here have been any mention of the Syrians! There
was necessarily something required which was very striking, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>which, having but recently occurred, was still
vividly remembered. But the matter was altogether different in the case of Amos.
Joel has to do with the enemies of Judah only; Amos, with those of the kingdom of
Israel also, among whom the Syrians were the most dangerous. Hence, he begins with
them at once. The crime with which he charges them in chap. i. 3, that they had
threshed the inhabitants of Gilead with threshing instruments of iron, concerns
the kingdom of Israel only. The same applies to the Ammonites and Moabites also,
who, in like manner, are mentioned by Amos, and not by Joel. The Ammonites are charged
in Amos i. 13 with ripping up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge
their border; and the crime of the Moabites, rebuked in chap. ii. 1, occurred, very
probably, during the time of, or after, the expedition against them, mentioned in
2 Kings iii.&mdash;the real instigator of which was the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="normal">We must indeed be astonished that <i>Hitzig</i>, <i>Ewald</i>,
<i>Meier</i>, <i>Baur</i>, and others, after the example of <i>Credner</i>, have
likewise declared in favour of the view that the prophecies of Joel were composed
under Joash. None of the arguments, however, by which they attempt to support their
view, can stand examination.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;There is nowhere, as yet, the slightest allusion to the Assyrians,&quot;
says <i>Ewald</i>. But neither is any such found in Amos, nor in the first part
of Hosea. An irruption, however, such as former times had not known,&mdash;an overflowing,
as it were, by the heathen, such as could by no means proceed from the small neighbouring
nations, but from extensive kingdoms only, is here also brought into view. Joel
is, in this respect, in strict agreement with Amos, who embodies his prophecy concerning
this event, in chap. vi. 14, in these words: &quot;For, behold, I raise up against you,
O house of Israel, Gentile people, saith the Lord, the God of hosts, and they shall
afflict you from Hamath unto the river of the wilderness.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;There breathes here still the unbroken warlike spirit of the
times of Deborah and David,&quot; <i>Ewald</i> further remarks. But is there in the fourth
(third) chapter any trace of self-help on the part of the people? Judgment upon
the Gentiles is executed without any human instrumentality, by God,&mdash;not by His earthly,
but by His heavenly &quot;heroes,&quot; who are sent down <span class="pagenum">[Pg 295]</span>from
heaven to earth, and who make short work with these fancied earthly heroes. Compare
chap. iv. (iii.) 11-13, where the address is directed to the heavenly ministers
of God, at the head of whom the Angel of the Covenant must be supposed to be: Ps.
ciii. 20; Rev. xix. 14. <i>Such</i> a victory of the kingdom of God, all the prophets
announce,&mdash;not only Isaiah and Micah, but also Ezekiel, <i>e.g.</i>, in chap. xxxviii.
and xxxix.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;We perceive here the prophetic order in Jerusalem, still in the
same ancient greatness as when Nathan and Gad may have exercised their office at
the time of David. A whole people, without contradicting or murmuring, still depend
upon the prophet. He desires the observance of a grievous ordinance, and willingly
it is performed; his word is still like a higher command which all cheerfully obey.
Nor is any discord to be seen in the nation, nor any wicked idolatry or superstition;
the ancient simple faith still lives in them, unbroken and undivided.&quot; So <i>Ewald</i>
still further remarks. But this argument rests upon a false supposition; a conversion
of the people at the time of the prophet is not at all spoken of. The pretended
repentance is to take place <i>in future</i>,&mdash;which, according to chap. i. 4, we
must conceive of as being still afar off, namely, in the time after the divine judgments
have broken in. And as to a progress in the apostasy of the people, it can scarcely
be proved that such took place in the time betwixt Joash and Uzziah. Between these
two, we do not find any new stage of corruption. The idolatry of Solomon, and the
abominations of Athaliah, had exercised their influence, even as early as under
Joash. How deep the rent was which, even then, went through the nation, is shown
by the fact, that, according to 2 Chron. xxiv. 17, 18, after the death of Jehoiada,
Joash gave way to the <i>urgent demands of the prince&#39;s of Judah</i>, and allowed
free scope to idolatry. Moreover, the threatening announcement of a judgment, which
is to extend even to the destruction of the temple, proves how deep the apostasy
was at the time of Joel. Where a judgment is thus threatened, which, in its terrors,
far surpasses all former judgments, the &quot;ancient faith&quot; certainly cannot have been
very vigorous.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The Messianic idea appears here in its generality and indefiniteness,
without being as yet concentrated in the person of an ideal king,&quot; <i>Hitzig</i>
remarks. But if this argument were at all <span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>
valid, we should have to go back even beyond the time of Joash. Solomon, David,
and Jacob already knew the personal Messiah. The prophets, however, do not everywhere
proclaim everything which they know. Even in Isaiah, there occur long Messianic
descriptions, in which the Messiah Himself is not to be found. In Joel, moreover,
everything is collected around the person of the &quot;Teacher of righteousness.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Joel,&quot; it is further remarked, &quot;must have prophesied at a time
when the Philistine and other nations, who had become so haughty under Jehoram,
had but lately ventured upon destructive plundering expeditions as far as Jerusalem,
2 Chron. xxi. 10 ff.&quot; This argument would be plausible, if the injuries inflicted
by the Philistines and the inhabitants of Tyrus had not appeared in equally lively
colours before the mind of Amos (chap. i. 6-10), who, at all events, prophesied
between seventy and eighty years after these events. It is just this fact which
should teach caution in the application of such arguments. The recollection of such
facts could not be lost, as long as the disposition continued from which they originated.
It was as if they had happened in the present; for, under similar circumstances,
similar events would have again immediately taken place. The passage chap. iv. 19,
&quot;Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence
against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in the land,&quot;
shows also how lively was the recollection of injuries sustained long ago. Egypt
and Edom in that passage are mentioned individually, in order to designate the enemies
of the people of God in general, and yet with an allusion to deeds perpetrated by
the Egyptians and Edomites properly so called. As the suffix in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1501;</span> must be referred to the sons of Judah&mdash;for
we have no historical account of a bloody deed perpetrated against Judah by the
Edomites in their own land, and it was the land of Judah which was invaded and devastated
by the host of locusts&mdash;we can think, in the case of the Egyptians, only of the invasion
under Rehoboam (1 Kings xiv.), and in the case of the Edomites, only of the great
carnage which they made in Judah, during the time at which David carried on war
with Aram in Arabia and on the Euphrates,&mdash;probably at a time when he had sustained
heavy losses in that warfare; compare my Comment. on Ps. xliv. and lx. Of any
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span> similar later occurrence there is no account
extant. It is only by a fanciful exposition that &quot;the innocent blood&quot; can be found
in 2 Kings viii. 20-22. The Edomites at that time kept only a defensive position,
and did not come into the land of Judah. &quot;The innocent blood&quot; implies a war of conquest,
and a hostile inroad.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;In chap. iv. (iii.) 4-7, Joel promises a return to the citizens
of Judah, who had been carried away by the Philistines under Jehoram; and, hence,
an age cannot have elapsed since that event.&quot; Thus <i>Meier</i> argues. But the
words, &quot;Behold, I raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them,&quot; contain
no special prediction, but only the application of the general truth, that God gathers
together the dispersed of Judah, and brings back again the exiled of Israel; and
it is only requisite to compare concerning them. Gen. xv. 16, &quot;In the fourth generation
they shall come hither again,&quot; and l. 24, &quot;God will visit you, and bring you out
of this land.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">We thus arrive at the conclusion that Joel occupies the right
place in the Canon.</p>
<p class="normal">The assertion that Joel belonged to the priestly order, is as
baseless as the similar one regarding Habakkuk, and as the supposition that the
author of the Chronicles was a musician.</p>
<p class="normal">The book contains a connected description. It begins with a graphic
account of the ruin which God will bring upon His apostate Congregation, by means
of foreign enemies. These latter represent themselves to the prophet in his spiritual
vision as an all-destroying swarm of locusts. The fundamental thought is this:&mdash;
&quot;Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together,&quot;&mdash;wherever
corruption manifests itself in the Congregation of the Lord, punishment will be
inflicted. Because God has sanctified Himself <i>in</i> the Congregation, and has
graciously imparted to her His holiness. He must therefore sanctify Himself upon
her,&mdash;must manifest His holiness in her punishment, if she has become like the profane
world. He cannot allow that, after the Spirit has departed, the dead body should
still continue to appear as His kingdom, but strips off the mask of hypocrisy from
His degenerate Church, by representing her outwardly as that which, by her guilt,
she has become inwardly. This thought commonly appears in a special
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span> application, by the mention of the name of
the particular people whom the Lord is, in the immediate future, to employ for the
realization of it. In the case before us, however, He is satisfied with pointing
to the dignity and power inherent in Him. The enemies are designated only as <i>
people from the North</i>. But it was from the North&mdash;from Syria&mdash;that all the principal
invasions of Palestine proceeded. Hence there is no reason either to think of one
of them exclusively, or to exclude one. On the contrary, the comprehensive character
of the description distinctly appears in i. 4. It is there, at the very threshold,
intimated, that the heathenish invasion will be a fourfold one,&mdash;that Israel shall
become the prey of four successive extensive empires. Joel&#39;s mission fell at the
commencement of the written prophecy; and in harmony with this, he gives only an
outline of that which it was reserved for the later prophets to fill up, and to
carry out in its details, by the mention of the name of each single empire, as the
times moved on. It was enough that Joel prophesied the destruction by these great
empires, even before any one of them had appeared on the stage of history, and that
he was enabled to point even to the fourfold number of them.</p>
<p class="normal">The threat of punishment, joined with exhortations to repentance,
to which the people willingly listened, and humbled themselves before the Lord,
continues down to chap. ii. 17. With this is connected the proclamation of salvation&mdash;which
extends down to chap. iii. 2 (ii. 29). The showing of mercy begins with the fact,
that God sends the <i>Teacher of righteousness</i>. He directs the attention of
the people to the design of their sufferings, and invites the weary and heavy laden
to come to the Lord, that He may refresh them. His voice is heard by those who are
of a broken heart; and there then follows rich divine blessing, with its consummation&mdash;the
outpouring of the Spirit. Both&mdash;the sending of the Teacher of righteousness, and
the outpouring of the Spirit&mdash;had their preliminary fulfilments; the first of which
took place soon after the commencement of the devastation by the locusts, in the
time of the Assyrians,&mdash;a second, after the destruction by the Babylonians had come
upon the people,&mdash;a third, after the visitation by the Greek tyranny under the Maccabees.
But the chief reference of the prophecy is, throughout, to Christ, and to the vouchsafement
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span> of the blessing, and to the outpouring of
the Spirit, originating in His mediation.</p>
<p class="normal">The announcement of salvation for the Covenant-people is, in the
third and last part, followed by the opposite of it, viz., the announcement of judgments
upon the enemies of the Congregation of God. Their hatred of it, proceeding from
hatred to God, is employed by Him, indeed, as a means of chastising and purifying
His Church; but it does not, for that reason, cease to be an object of His punitive
justice. The fundamental idea of this part of the book is expressed in 1 Pet. iv.
17 by the words: &quot;For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
God. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the
Gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and
the sinner appear?&quot; The description bears here also, as in the second and first
parts, a comprehensive character. That which, in the course of history, is realized
in a long series of single acts of divine interposition against the enemies of the
Church, is here brought together in a single scene. The overthrow of Assyria, Babylon,
the Persian and Grecian monarchies, is comprehended in this prophecy. But its final
fulfilment must be sought for only in the Messianic time. This is sufficiently evident
from the relation of this part, to the second. Having given ear to the Teacher of
righteousness, and the Spirit having been poured out upon her, the Congregation
has become an object of the loving providence of God. From this flows the judgment
upon her enemies. If, then, the promise of the Teacher of righteousness and of the
outpouring of the Spirit be, in substance, Messianic, so, the judgment too must,
in substance, bear a Messianic character. The same appears from iv. (iii.) 18, according
to which passage, simultaneously with the judgments, there cometh forth, from the
house of the Lord, a fountain which watereth the valley of Shittim&mdash;the waters of
salvation which water the dry land of human need. (Compare the remarks on Ezek.
xlvii,; Zech. xiv. 8; and my <i>Comment. on Revel.</i> xxii. 1.) This feature, however,
clearly points to the Messianic time.</p>
<p class="normal">We must here, however, avoid confounding the substance with the
form,&mdash;the idea with the temporary clothing which the prophet puts upon it, in accordance
with the nature of prophetic <span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span> vision, in which,
necessarily, all that is spiritual must be represented in outward sketches and forms.
This form is as follows:&mdash;In the place nearest to the temple, and which was able
to contain a great multitude of people, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, all nations
are gathered. (The valley very probably received its name from the appellation which,
in the passage under consideration, the prophet gives to it, in order to mark its
destination; for Jehoshaphat means, &quot;the Lord judges,&quot; or &quot;Valley of Judgment.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_300a" href="#ftn_300a">[1]</a></sup>)
The Lord, enthroned in the temple, exercises judgment upon them. In this manner&mdash;in
outward forms of perception&mdash;the idea is brought out, that the judgment upon the
Gentiles is an effect of the kingdom of God; that they are not punished on account
of their violation of the natural law, but because of the hostile position which
they had occupied against the teachers of God&#39;s revealed truth,&mdash;against the Lord
Himself who is in His Church. Every violation of the natural law may be pardoned
to those who have not stood in any other relation to God, even although they should
have <span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span> proceeded to the most fearful extent
in depravity. They who were once disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited
in the days of Noah, were not as yet given over to complete condemnation, but were
kept in prison until Christ came and preached to them. &quot;This was the iniquity of
Sodom: fulness of bread, and abundance of peace, were in her and her daughters;
yet the hand of the poor and needy they did not assist; but they were haughty and
committed abomination before the Lord: therefore He took them away as He saw good.&quot;
But, nevertheless, the Lord will, at some future time, turn the captivity (the misery)
of this Sodom and her daughters, and they shall be restored as they were before,&mdash;not
corporeally, for their seed is utterly rooted out from the earth, and even their
place is destroyed, but spiritually; compare Ezek. xvi. 49 ff. But, on the other
hand, far more severe punishments are inflicted upon those who have rejected, not
the abstract, but the concrete God,&mdash;not the God who is shut up in the heavens, but
the God who powerfully manifests Himself on earth, in His Church. It is true, that
as long as this revelation is still an imperfect one&mdash;as it was under the Old Testament
dispensation&mdash;and hence the guilt of rejecting Him less, mercy may still be shown.
External destruction does not involve spiritual ruin. Moab, indeed, is destroyed,
so that it is no longer a people, because it has exalted itself against the Lord;
yet, &quot;in the latter days I will turn the captivity of Moab, saith the Lord,&quot; Jer.
xlviii. 47. But when the revelation of the grace of God has become perfect, His
justice also will be perfectly revealed against all who reject it, and rise in hostility
against those who are the bearers of it: &quot;Their worm shall not die, neither shall
their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh,&quot; Is. lxvi.
24. These remarks contain the key to all which the Lord declares as to the future
judgment which, in its completion, belongs only to the future world. It is not the
world as such, but that world to which the Gospel has been declared, and in the
midst of which the Church has been founded, which forms the object of it; compare
Matt. xxiv. 14.</p>

	<sup class="ftnRef">[1]</sup></a> <i>Hofmann</i> (<i>Weissag. u. Erfül.</i>
	i. S. 203) has revived the explanation, according to which the valley of Jehoshaphat
	is to be understood as the valley in which, under Jehoshaphat, judgment was
	executed upon several Gentile nations. But this locality, the desert of Thekoa,
	which was about three hours distance from Jerusalem (compare my <i>Comment.
	on the Psalms</i>, in the <i>Introduction to Ps.</i> xlvi. xlviii. lxxxiii.),
	is at too great a distance from the temple, where, according to vers. 16 and
	17, the Lord holds His judgment upon the nations. Tradition has rightly perceived
	that the valley of Jehoshaphat can be sought for only in the immediate vicinity
	of the temple. In favour of the valley of Jehoshaphat now so called, &quot;at the
	high east brink of Moriah, the temple-hill&quot; (<i>Ritter</i>, <i>Erdk.</i> xv.
	1, S. 559; xvi. 1, S. 329), is also Zech. vi. 1-8 (compare the remarks on that
	passage). From the circumstance that there is, first, the mention of the name,
	and, then, the statement of its signification, &quot;And I gather all nations, and
	bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and <i>plead</i> with them there,&quot;
	<i>Hofmann</i> infers that the name must have already existed as a proper name.
	There is, however, an analogy in Num. xx. 1: &quot;And the people encamped at Kadesh;&quot;&mdash;but
	the place received the name Kadesh only because of the event to be subsequently
	related: previous to that, its name was Barnea. (Compare <i>Dissert. on Gen.
	of the Pent.</i> vol. ii. p. 310 ff.) The two theological names of the place,
	which arose only from the event recorded in Num. xx., occur even as early as
	Gen. xiv. 7. The natural name of the valley of Jehoshaphat is, moreover, in
	all likelihood, <i>King&#39;s Dale</i>; compare Gen. xiv. 17; 2 Sam. xviii. 18;

<h3><a name="div3_302" href="#div3Ref_302">JOEL I.-II. 17.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">We shall not dwell here for any length of time upon the history
of the expositions of this passage. It has been given with sufficient minuteness
by <i>Pococke</i> and <i>Marckius</i> among older writers, and by <i>Credner</i>
among the more modern. We content ourselves with remarking that the figurative exposition
is the more ancient, having been adopted by the Chaldee Paraphrast, and by the Jews
mentioned by <i>Jerome</i>, and that we cannot by any means, as <i>Credner</i> does,
derive it from doctrinal considerations only; for many, with whom such considerations
weighed, as <i>Bochart</i>, <i>Pococke</i>, and <i>J. D. Michaelis</i>, do not approve
of it; whilst, on the other hand, there are among its defenders not a few who were
guided by just the opposite motives, such as <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Eckermann</i>,
<i>Berthold</i> (Einl. S. 1607 ff.), and <i>Theiner</i>. Two preliminary questions,
however, require to be answered, before we can proceed to the main investigation.</p>
<p class="normal">1. Does Joel here describe a present, or a future calamity? The
former has been asserted, in former times, by <i>Luther</i> and <i>Calvin</i> (compare,
especially, his commentary on chap. i. 4), and in more recent times, with special
confidence, by <i>Credner</i>. But there is nothing to favour this view. The frequent
use of the Preterites would prove something in support of it, provided only we were
not standing on prophetical ground. They are, moreover, found quite in the same
manner in chap. iv.&mdash;in that portion which, by all interpreters unanimously, is referred
to the future. And yet, if this view were to be acknowledged as sound, it ought
to commend itself by stringent considerations, inasmuch as the prophetic analogy
is, <i>a priori</i>, against it. There is not found anywhere in the prophets so
long and so detailed a description of the present or the past. But, moreover, if
we once give up the reference to the future, we could think of the past only; for
in chap; ii. 18, 19, the description of the salvation following upon the misery,
is connected with the preceding context by the Future with <i>vav conversivum</i>.
If, then, the scene of inward vision be forsaken, and everything referred to external
reality, the calamity described in the preceding context must likewise be viewed
as one already entirely past, and the salvation as already actually existing. It
can be proved, however, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span> from the contents,
by incontrovertible special reasons, that the reference to the future is alone the
correct one. The day of the Lord is several times spoken of as being at hand, which
may be explained from the circumstance, that God&#39;s judgment upon His Church is a
necessary effect of His justice, which never rests, but always shows itself as active.
When, therefore, its object&mdash;the sinful apostasy of the people&mdash;is already in existence,
its manifestation must also of necessity be expected; and although not the last
and highest manifestation, yet such an one as serves for a prelude to it. The day
of the Lord is, therefore, continually coming, is never absolutely distant; and
its being spoken of as <i>at hand</i> is a necessary consequence of the saying,
&quot;Whereseover<!--see 1854 ed.--> the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
together,&quot;&mdash;a declaration founded upon the divine nature, and therefore ever true.
(Compare my <i>Commentary on the Apocalypse</i> i. 1.) This designation is first
found in i. 15: &quot;Alas! for the day, for the day of the Lord is <i>at hand</i>, and
as a destruction from the Almighty does it come.&quot; Here, two expedients for evasion
have been tried. <i>Justi</i> maintained that &quot;the day is at hand&quot; was equivalent
to &quot;the day is there,&quot;&mdash;an opinion which does not deserve any further refutation.
<i>Holzhausen</i>, <i>Credner</i>, and <i>Hitzig</i> suppose that, by &quot;the day of
the Lord,&quot; we are not to understand the devastation by the locusts, but some severe
judgment, to which that served as a prelude. This supposition is, however, opposed,
first of all, by the verbal parallel passage in Isa. xiii. 6: &quot;Howl ye, for the
day of the Lord is at hand; it cometh as a destruction from the Almighty,&quot;&mdash;where
the day of the Lord cannot be any other than that which is described in the preceding
context. But this opinion is further opposed by the circumstance, that, in the subsequent
context, there is not the slightest trace of any other judgment than that of the
devastation by the locusts; on the contrary, with its termination, the whole period
of suffering comes to an end, as regards the Covenant-people, and the time of blessing
upon them and of judgment upon their enemies begins. But the necessity for understanding,
by &quot;the day of the Lord at hand,&quot; the devastation by the locusts, and hence, for
viewing the latter as still future, is even more clearly seen from the second passage,
chap. ii. 1, 2: &quot;Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain;
let all the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span> inhabitants of the land tremble,
for the day of the Lord <i>hath come</i>, for <i>nigh at hand</i>, a day of darkness
and gloominess, a day of clouds and fogs, as the morning-red spread upon the mountains,
a people numerous and strong; there hath not been the like from eternity, neither
shall there be any more after it, even through the years of all generations.&quot; That,
by &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; which the prophet, from the standing-point of his inward
vision, here speaks of as having already come, and as being in reality nigh at hand,
we must understand the same day as that which is minutely described in the preceding
and subsequent context, viz., the devastation by the locusts, appears, in the first
place, from the verbal parallel passage, Ezek. xxx. 2, which likewise speaks of
one day only: &quot;Thou son of man, prophesy and say. Thus saith the Lord, Howl ye,
woe for the day! For the day is near, a day to the Lord, a day of clouds, the time
of the heathen it shall be.&quot; But what places the matter beyond all doubt are the
words: &quot;A people numerous and strong.&quot; These words, by which, according to what
follows, the locusts only can be understood, form an explanatory apposition to &quot;the
day of the Lord,&quot; &quot;the day of darkness,&quot; etc. To this we may further add, that,
by the last words, this judgment is represented as the most formidable, and the
last by which Judea shall be visited; so that we cannot by any means think of a
subsequent later day of the Lord. 2. Are the different names of the locusts designations
of various species of locusts, or are these, beside the common name of the locusts,
only poetical names, which denote the qualities coming into consideration? <i>Credner</i>
has attempted to prove the former. He maintains that Joel&#39;s description has to do
with two generations of locusts,&mdash;the first belonging to the end of one year,&mdash;the
second, to the beginning of the year following. The latter he thinks to be the offspring
of the former. In accordance with this hypothesis, he explains the different names,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> is, according to him, the migratory locust,
which visits Palestine chiefly in autumn; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;</span>,
elsewhere the general name of locusts, here the young brood;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>, the young locust in the last stage of
its transformation, or between the third and fourth casting of the skin;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;</span>, the perfect locust, proceeding from
the last transformation, and, hence, as the brood proceeded from the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> would be the same
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span>.</p>
<p class="normal"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span></p>
<p class="normal">It forms a general argument against this hypothesis, that, according
to it, the prophet should enter so deeply and minutely into the natural history
of locusts, that a Professor of that science might learn from him. There is nothing
analogous to this, either in Scripture generally, or in the Prophets particularly.
The difficulty, moreover, increases, when we assume&mdash;what has been already proved&mdash;that
the description refers to the future. The religious impression which the prophet
has, after all, solely in view, would not gain, but suffer by such a minute detail
in the description of a future natural event,&mdash;especially such as a devastation by
locusts.</p>
<p class="normal">A closer examination proves that the whole explanation of the
names of the locusts, upon which the hypothesis is built, is untenable. It appears,
then, that the prophet knows of only one kind of locusts, which he divides into
four hosts; and that, with the exception of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;</span>,
the names are not those of natural history, but poetical, and taken from the qualities
of the locusts.</p>
<p class="normal">Let us first demonstrate that the interpretation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>, upon which <i>Credner</i> founds that
of the other names, is inadmissible. This interpretation, he maintains (S. 295),
is put beyond all doubt by the passage, Nah. iii. 16: &quot;The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> casts its skin and flies away.&quot; The merchants,
who constituted the principal part of the population of Nineveh, are, according
to him, compared to a <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> which flies away,
after having cast his skin for the third or last time. But this passage of Nahum,
when minutely examined and correctly interpreted, is by itself sufficient to refute
that opinion concerning the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>. In ver. 15,
it is said concerning Nineveh: &quot;There shall the fire devour thee, the sword shall
cut thee off, it shall eat thee up, as the <i>licker</i> (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>):
make thyself many as the <i>lickers</i>, make thyself many as the locusts. Ver.
16: Thou hast multiplied thy merchants like the stars of heaven; <i>lickers broke
through and flew away</i>. Ver. 17: Thy princes are like locusts, and thy captains
are as a host of grasshoppers, which camp on the hedges in the day of cold. The
sun has risen, and they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.&quot;
This passage just proves that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> must be
<i>winged</i> locusts. The inhabitants of Nineveh are numerous like the locusts;
numerous are her rich merchants; but suddenly there cometh upon them a numberless
host of locusts, who rob <span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span> them of everything,
and fly away. They who rob and fly away, in ver. 16, are not the merchants, but
the enemies. This becomes quite evident from the comparison of ver. 15, where quite
the same antithesis is found between&mdash;&quot;The sword shall eat thee up as the lickers&quot;
(Nominat.), and &quot;Make thyself many as the lickers.&quot; The verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1513;&#1496;</span>, in its common signification, <i>irruit</i>,
<i>invasit ad praedam agendam</i>, is here, in reference to the merchants, very
significant. But what is decisive against the explanation of <i>Credner</i> is this:&mdash;that
the signification &quot;to cast the skin&quot; cannot be established at all, and that the
whole sense is utterly unsuitable. For the discourse is not here, by any means,
of mercenaries or foreign traders, but of the native merchants of Nineveh, just
as, in the subsequent verses, the discourse is about her own nobles. How then could
that image be suitable, which must certainly denote a safe transition from one state
into a better?&mdash;<i>Credner</i> moreover refers to Jer. li. 27, where to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> the quality
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1505;&#1502;&#1512;</span>, <i>horridus</i>, is ascribed. This, according
to him, is to be referred to the rough, horn-like coverings of the wings of the
young locusts. But, according to the context, and to the analogy of the parallel
passage, li. 14, we should rather expect that &quot;horrid&quot; is here a designation of
the multitude. (Compare the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#8134;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>
of the LXX.) But it is still more natural to give to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1505;&#1502;&#1512;</span> the signification of &quot;awful,&quot; &quot;terrible.&quot;
(Compare Ps. cxix. 120, where the verb occurs with the meaning &quot;to shudder.&quot;)&mdash;That
by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>, not the young brood, but the winged
locusts are to be understood, appears also from a comparison of Ps. cv. 34 with
Exod. x. 12 ff. In Exod. a single army of <i>flying</i> locusts overspread Egypt;
the Psalmist, in recalling this event to memory, says: &quot;He spake, and the locusts
came, and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> without number.&quot; From this passage,
especially when compared with Ps. lxxvii. 46, where, instead of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> is interchanged with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;</span>, which alone is found in Exod., it is
very clearly seen that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>, the <i>licker</i>,
is nothing else than a poetical epithet of the locusts. It never occurs, indeed,
in prose; and this can be the less accidental, as <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span>, the <i>gnawer</i>, is also never found in prose writings, and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;</span> only once, in the prayer of Solomon,
1 Kings viii. 37&mdash;as that which it is in reality, as a mere attribute to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;</span>. That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> has its name from the eating, is shown by Nah. iii. 15: &quot;The sword shall
eat thee up as the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span>.&quot; And, in addition
to this, we may <span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span> further urge, that the exposition
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;</span> is altogether fictitious, and contradicted
by all the passages;&mdash;that the prophet in ii. 25 inverts the order, and puts the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> last, from which it is certainly to be
safely inferred that the arrangement in i. 4 is not a chronological one;&mdash;that <i>
Credner</i> himself, by his being obliged to grant that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;</span>
do not signify a particular kind of locusts, raises suspicions against his interpreting
the two other names of particular kinds;&mdash;and that if this interpretation were to
be considered as correct, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;</span> must denote the locusts as fully grown.
But that is by no means the case. The origin of the name
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span> is, moreover, clearly shown by Amos iv.
9: &quot;Your vineyards, your fig-trees, and your olive-trees,&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span>
devours them.&quot; As regards the corn, other divine means of destruction had been mentioned
immediately before; the trees alone then remained for the locusts, and they received
a name corresponding to this special destination, viz.,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1490;&#1494;&#1501;</span>, the <i>gnawer</i>.&mdash;The verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1500;</span> is, in Deut. xxviii. 38, used of the devouring
of the locusts, and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;</span> never occurs excepting
where the locusts are viewed in this capacity. (Besides the passages already quoted,
compare Is. xxxiii. 4.)</p>
<p class="normal">The following also may be considered. The description of the ravages
of the second brood is, according to <i>Credner</i>, to begin in chap. ii. 4. But
the suffix in ver. 4 refers directly to the winged locusts spoken of in vers. 1-3;
and in the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;</span> they are the subject.</p>
<p class="normal">And now, every one may judge what value is to be attached to a
hypothesis which has everything against it, and nothing in its favour, and the essential
suppositions of which&mdash;such as the departure of the swarms, their leaving their eggs
behind, their death in the Red Sea&mdash;are, as the author of the hypothesis himself
confesses, passed over in silence by the prophet.</p>
<p class="normal">We may now proceed to the solution of our proper problem. There
are no general reasons, either against the figurative, or against the literal interpretation;
neither of them has any unfavourable prejudice which can be urged against it. A
devastation by real locusts is threatened, in the Pentateuch, against the transgressors
of the law, Deut. xxviii. 38, 39; against the Egyptians, the Lord actually made
use of this, among other methods of punishment; and a devastation in Israel by locusts
is, in Amos iv. 9, represented as an effect of divine anger.&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>On the other hand, figurative representations
of that kind are of very common occurrence. In Isaiah, <i>e.g.</i>, the invading
Assyrians and Egyptians appear, in a continuous description, as swarms of flies
and bees. The comparison of hostile armies with locusts is very common, not only
on account of their multitude (from which circumstance the locusts received their
name in Hebrew), but also on account of the sudden surprise, and the devastation:
compare Judges vi. 5; Jer. xlvi. 23, li. 27; Judith ii. 11. Several times a hostile
invasion also is represented under the <i>image</i> and <i>symbol</i> of the plague
of the locusts. In Nah. iii. 15-17, the Assyrians appear in the form of locusts,&mdash;and
that this is not only on account of their numbers, but also on account of the devastations
which they make, is shown by the comparison with the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1500;&#1511;</span> in ver. 15;&mdash;and just in the same manner
are the enemies described who accomplish their overthrow. And,&mdash;what is completely
analogous,&mdash;in Amos vii. 1-3, the prophet beholds the approaching divine judgment
under the image of a swarm of locusts, just as, in ver. 4, under that of a fire,
and in ver. 7, under that of a plumb-line. All these three images are in substance
identical; their meaning is expressed in ver. 9 by the words: &quot;The high places of
Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be destroyed.&quot; The
locusts denote destroying hostile armies; the fire denotes war; and the plumb-line,
the destruction to be accomplished by the enemies. It was so much the more natural
to represent the divine judgment under the image of a devastation by locusts&mdash;as
is done also in Rev. ix. 3 ff.&mdash;because, formerly, it had actually manifested itself
in this way in Egypt. The figurative representation had therefore a significant
substratum in the history of the past. But it is, throughout, the custom of the
prophets to describe the future under the image of the analogous past, which, as
it were, is revived in it.&mdash;It ought to be still further remarked, that we must,
<i>a priori</i>, be the less indisposed to admit a detailed symbolical representation
in Joel, as the two prophets, betwixt whom he is placed, have likewise such symbolical
portions.</p>
<p class="normal">The decision depends, therefore, upon the internal character of
the description itself. An allegory must betray itself as such, by significant hints;
where these are wanting, it is arbitrary to assume its existence. Following the
order of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span> text, we shall bring together
everything of this kind which we find in it.</p>
<p class="normal">The words, even, of the introduction,&mdash;Hath any such thing happened
in your days, and in the days of your fathers? Of it you shall tell your sons, and
your sons to their sons, and their sons to the succeeding generation,&quot;&mdash;scarcely
permit us to think of a devastation by locusts in the literal sense. It could only
be by means of the grossest exaggeration&mdash;which, if it were far from any prophet,
was certainly so from the simple and mild Joel&mdash;that he could represent, as the greatest
disaster which ever befell, or should ever befall the nation, a devastation by locusts
which was, after all, only a transitory evil. For it is the greatness of the disaster
which is implied in the call to relate it to the latest posterity; no later suffering
should be so great as to cause this one to be forgotten.</p>
<p class="normal">We must not overlook the expression in ver. 6: &quot;<i>For a nation</i>
(<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;</span>) has come up over my land.&quot; &quot;Nation,&quot;
according to most interpreters, is thought to signify the mere multitude; but in
that case, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1501;</span> would certainly have been used,
as is done in Prov. xxx. 25, 26, concerning the ants. In
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;</span> there is implied not only the idea of
what is hostile&mdash;this <i>Credner</i> too acknowledges&mdash;but also of what is profane.
This, indeed, is the principal idea; and, on this account, even the degenerate Covenant-people
several times receive the name <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;</span>. That this
principal idea is here likewise applicable, is evident from the antithesis: &quot;Over
my land.&quot; It is true, that the suffix cannot be referred to Jehovah, as is done
by <i>J. H. Michaelis</i> and others, although the antithesis would thus most strikingly
appear; but as little can we refer it, as is done by modern interpreters, to the
prophet as an individual; for, in this case the antithesis would be lost altogether.
The comparison of vers. 7 and 19 clearly shows that, according to a common practice
(compare the Introduction to Micah, and the whole prophecy of Habakkuk), the prophet
speaks in the name of the people of God. A strange, unheard-of event! A heathen
host has invaded the land of the people of God! The antithesis is in ii. 18: &quot;Then
the Lord was jealous for His land, and spared His people.&quot; We do not think that
the prophet loses sight of his image. He designates the locust as the heathen host;
but he would not have chosen this designation, which, when literally
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span> understood, is very strange, unless the matter
had induced him to do so. If it be understood figuratively, Amos vi. 14 entirely
harmonizes with it.&mdash;In the same verse (Joel i. 6) it is said: &quot;His teeth, the teeth
of a lion, cheek teeth of a lion to him;&quot; on which Rev. ix. 8 is to be compared.
This comparison is quite suitable to figurative locusts, to furious enemies (compare
Is. v. 29; Nah. ii. 12, 13; Jer. ii. 15, iv. 7, xlix. 19; Ezek. xxxii. 2; Dan. vii.
4), but not to natural locusts; for the lion cannot possibly be the symbol of mere
voracity.</p>
<p class="normal">It is remarkable, that in the description of the locusts in this
verse, and throughout, their flying is not mentioned at all. It is only in chap.
ii. 2, &quot;Day of darkness and gloominess, day of clouds and thick darkness,&quot; that
<i>Credner</i> supposes such an allusion to exist. The darkness is, according to
him, in consequence of the swarm of locusts coming up in the skies. But the incorrectness
of such a supposition is immediately perceived, upon a comparison of chap. ii. 10.
Before the host, and before it arrives, the earth quakes, the heavens tremble, sun
and moon cover themselves with darkness, and the stars withdraw their shining. It
is only after all this has happened, that the Lord approaches at the head of His
host. It is not from this host, therefore, that the darkness can proceed. On the
contrary, the darkening of the heavens, as is quite conclusively shown by the numerous
almost literally agreeing parallel passages (compare the remarks on Zech. xiv. 6),
is the symbol of the anger of God, the sign that He approaches as a Judge, and an
Avenger. But in what way could the omission of every reference to the flying of
the locusts, in a description so minute, be accounted for other than this: that
the reality presented nothing corresponding to this feature?</p>
<p class="normal">It is only the heaviest and most continuous suffering, and not
a transitory plague by locusts, which can justify the call in i. 8: &quot;Howl like a
virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.&quot; This verse forms the
transition to ver. 9, where the sacrifice in the house of Jehovah appears as cut
off, and connects Joel with Hosea, in whom the image, of which the outlines only
are given here, appears finished. Zion has also lost the friend of her youth&mdash;the
Lord; compare Prov. ii. 17: &quot;Who forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgot the
covenant of her God;<!--1854 ed inserted-->&quot; Is. liv. 6; Jer. ii. 2, iii. 4.&mdash;Of
great <span class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</span> importance for the question under consideration
are ver. 9: &quot;The meat-offering and drink-offering are cut off from the house of
the Lord;&quot; and ver. 13: &quot;Gird yourselves and lament, ye priests, howl ye ministers
of the altar, come, spend all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God; for the
meat-offering and drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.&quot; It
is quite inconceivable that the want of provisions, resulting from a natural devastation
by real locusts, could have been the reason that the meat-offering and drink-offering,
which, in a material point of view, were of so little value, should have been withheld
from the Lord; inasmuch as the cessation of it appears in these passages as the
consummation of the national calamity. During the siege of Jerusalem by Pompey,
the legal sacrifices existed, according to <i>Josephus</i> (<i>Arch.</i> xiv. 4,
§ 3), even amidst the greatest dangers to life, during the irruption of the enemies
into the city, and in the midst of the carnage. It is true that, during the last
siege by the Romans, when matters had come to an extremity, <i>Johannes</i> ordered
the sacrifices to be discontinued. But this was done, not from want of materials,
but because there were none to offer them&mdash;from <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8182;&#957;
&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#8115;</span>, as <i>Josephus</i> says (<i>Bell. Jud.</i> vi. 2, § 1; compare <i>
Reland</i> in <i>Havercamp</i> on this passage)&mdash;and to the great dissatisfaction
of the people in the city, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8001; &#948;&#8134;&#956;&#959;&#963; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#962; &#7936;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8150;</span>.
The national view is expressed in what <i>Josephus</i> says on this occasion to
Johannes, to whom he had been sent by Titus on account of this event: &quot;If any man
should rob thee of thy daily food, thou, most wicked man, wouldst certainly consider
him as thine enemy. Dost thou then think that thou wilt have for thine associate
in this war, God, whom thou hast robbed of His eternal worship?&quot; But the sound explanation
readily suggests itself, as soon as it is admitted that behind the locusts the Gentiles
are concealed. In that case, Dan. ix. 27, where the destroyer makes sacrifice and
oblation to cease, is parallel. The destruction of the temple is also announced
by the contemporary Amos in chap. ix.; compare ii. 5: &quot;And I send fire upon Judah,
and it devours the palaces of Jerusalem.&quot; Of a similar purport, in the time after
Joel, is the passage in Micah, chap. iii. 12.</p>
<p class="normal">The words in ver. 15&mdash;&quot;Woe, for the day, for the day of the Lord
is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty does it come,&quot;&mdash;point to something
infinitely higher than a mere <span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span> desolation by
locusts in the literal sense. This appears from a comparison of Is. xiii. 6, where
they are taken, almost verbatim, from Joel, and used with a reference to the judgment
of the Lord upon the whole earth. This is granted even by <i>Credner</i> himself,
when he makes the vain attempt (compare S. 345) to refer them to a judgment different
from the devastation by the locust. The same is the case with <i>Maurer</i> and
<i>Hitzig</i>. How, indeed, is it at all conceivable that a national calamity, so
small and transient as a devastation by real locusts would have been, should have
been considered by the prophet as the day of the Lord of the people in the city,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8132;&#957;</span>, as the conclusion and completion
of all the judgments upon the Covenant-people? A conception like this would imply
such low notions of God&#39;s justice, and such a total misapprehension of the greatness
of human guilt, as we find in none of the Old Testament prophets, and, generally,
in none of the writers of Holy Scripture. That which the men of God under the Old
Testament, from the first&mdash;Moses&mdash;to the last, announce, is the total expulsion of
the people from the country which they defiled by their sins.</p>
<p class="normal">The image suddenly changes in vers. 19 and 20: &quot;To thee, O Lord,
do I cry. For fire devoureth the pastures of the wilderness, and flame burneth all
the trees of the field. Even the beasts of the field desire for Thee; for the fountains
of waters are dried up, and fire devoureth the pastures of the wilderness.&quot; The
divine punishment appears under the image of an all-devouring fire. Now, since we
cannot here think of a literal fire, it is certain that, in the preceding verses
also, a figurative representation prevails. <i>Holzhausen</i> and <i>Credner</i>
(S. 163), and others, attempt to evade this troublesome inference, by asserting
that fire and flame are here used instead of the heat of the sun, scorching everything.
But this assertion is, at all events, expressed in a distorted and awkward manner.
Fire and flame are never used of the heat of the sun. According to this view, it
ought rather to be said that the prophet represents the consuming heat, under the
image of fire poured down from heaven. But even this cannot be entertained. For
the parallel passage chap. ii. 3, &quot;Before him fire devoureth, and after him flame
burneth,&quot; shows that the fire, being immediately connected with the locusts, cannot
be a cause of destruction independent of, and co-ordinate with, them. That the locusts
are the sole cause of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span> the devastation, and
that there is not another cause besides them, viz., the heat, is evident also from
the words: &quot;As the garden of Eden is the land before them, and behind them a desolate
wilderness, and nothing is left by them.&quot; The burning anger of God is represented
under the image of a consuming and destroying fire, with a reference to the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah, in which the divine wrath really manifested itself in that
way. Under the image of fire, <i>war</i> also, one of the principal punishments
of God, is often represented. Thus, fire means the fire of war in Num. xxi. 28:
Amos i. 4, 7, 10, etc.; Jer. xlix. 27; Rev. viii. 8, 10. On the latter of these
passages, my Commentary may be compared. If, then, the fire spoken of in this passage
mean likewise the fire of war, and the locusts, the heathen enemies, the difficulty
presented by the connection of these two things is solved. The comparison of Amos
vii. here serves as a key. In vers. 1-3, the divine punishment is represented by
the prophet under the image of a great army of locusts laying waste the country,
which is just beginning to recover under Jeroboam II. after the former calamities
inflicted by the Syrians; and then in ver. 4, under the image of a great fire devouring
the sea (<i>i.e.</i>, the world), and eating up the holy land. This analogy is so
much the more important, the more impossible it is to overlook, in other passages
also, the points of agreement betwixt Joel and Amos. But the symbolical representation
goes still further; it extends even to the details. The beasts of the field are
the barbarous, heathen nations. In ver. 19, the desolations are described which
the fire of war accomplishes among Israel; in ver. 20, those which it effects among
the Gentiles: compare the antithesis between the beasts of the field and the sons
of Zion in ii. 22. In Is. lvi. 9, the beasts of the field likewise occur as a figurative
designation of the heathen. In Jer. xiv.&mdash;a prophecy which has been distorted by
expositors through a too literal interpretation&mdash;the image is, in vers. 5, 6, individualized
by the mention of particular wild beasts&mdash;the hind and the wild ass. Joel himself
indicates that the beasts in this description must, in general, be understood figuratively,
by using in ver. 18 the word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1513;&#1502;&#1493;</span>, which
can be explained only by &quot;become guilty,&quot; &quot;suffer punishment.&quot; (Compare Is. xxiv.
6: &quot;Therefore curse devoureth the land, and they that dwell in it become guilty;&quot;
and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span> Hos. xiv. 1.) The word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;</span>, which is never used of beasts, likewise
leads us to think of men. &quot;How do the beasts groan,&quot; is explained by &quot;All the merry-hearted
do groan,&quot; in Is. xxiv. 7. The words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1490; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;</span>,
in which there is an evident allusion to Ps. xlii. 2, must likewise appear strange,
if the description be understood literally. But what is decisive in favour of the
figurative interpretation is ii. 22: &quot;Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for
the pastures of the wilderness are green with grass, for the tree beareth her fruit,
the fig-tree and vine do yield their strength.&quot; The object of joy is here described,
first, figuratively, and then, literally. The pastures of the wilderness are green
with grass, <i>i.e.</i>, the tree, etc. It is only thus that the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> can be accounted for; it states the reason,
only when the pastures of the wilderness are not understood literally. <i>The fruits
of the trees are mentioned here as the ordinary food of the beasts of the field.</i>
<i>Hitzig</i>, it is true, remarks on this: &quot;That many beasts of the field feed
upon fruits of trees which they gather up, and that, <i>e.g.</i>, foxes eat grapes
also.&quot; But the point at issue here is the ordinary food; and Gen. i. 29, 30, where
the trees are given to man, and the grass to the beasts, is decisive as to the literal
or figurative interpretation. Under the image of unclean beasts&mdash;especially wild
beasts&mdash;the Gentiles appear also in Acts xi. 6.&mdash;Nor can &quot;the rivers of water&quot; (ver.
20) be understood literally. The water of rivers, brooks, and fountains, is, in
Scripture, the ordinary figure for the sources of sustenance, of thriving, wealth,
and prosperity; compare remarks on Rev. viii. 10.</p>
<p class="normal">Chap. ii. 2 is to be considered as indicating the reason which
induced Joel to choose this figurative representation. The words, &quot;There hath not
been anything the like from eternity, neither may there be any more after it, even
to the years of all generations,&quot; are borrowed, almost verbally, from Exod. x. 14.
The prophet thereby indicates that he transfers the past, in its individual definiteness,
to the future, which bears a substantial resemblance to it. What was then said of
the plague of locusts especially, is here applied to the calamity thereby prefigured.
From among all the judgments upon the Covenant-people (for these alone are spoken
of), this judgment is the highest and the last; and such the prophet could say,
only if the whole sum of divine judgments, up to their consummation, represented
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span> itself to his inner vision under the image
of the devastation by locusts. The absurdities into which men are led by the hypothesis
of a later origin of the Pentateuch, are here seen in a remarkable instance&mdash;viz.,
in the assertion of <i>Credner</i>, that the passage in Exodus is an imitation of
that of Joel. The verse immediately following, &quot;As the garden of Eden (<i>i.e.</i>,
Paradise) the land is before him,&quot; has an obvious reference to Genesis, not only
to Gen. ii. 8, but also to xiii. 10, where the vale of Siddim, before the divine
judgment, is compared to the garden of Jehovah&mdash;to Paradise.</p>
<p class="normal">In chap. ii. 6 it is said, &quot;Before him nations tremble.&quot; That
the mention of the <i>nations</i> here is but ill adapted to the literal interpretation,
appears from the circumstance, that while <i>Credner</i> understands by the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, Judah and Benjamin, <i>Hitzig</i> attempts
to explain it by people. But if, by the locusts, the heathen conquerors are designated,
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span> is quite in its place. When the powerful
heathen empires overflowed the land, Israel always formed only a part of a large
whole of nations; compare i. 19, ii. 22. Amos describes how the fire of war and
of the desire of conquest raged, not only in Israel, but among all the nations round
about, and consumed them. In addition to Amos chap. i. compare especially Amos vii.
4, 5, where, as objects of hostile visitation, are pointed out, first, the sea,
<i>i.e.</i>, the world, and then, the heritage of the Lord. According to Is. x.
6, the mission of Asshur was a very comprehensive one. In Habakkuk and Jer. chap.
xxv. the judgments which the Chaldeans inflicted upon Judah, appear only as a part
of a universal judgment upon all nations.</p>
<p class="normal">According to chap. ii. 7-9, the locusts take the city by storm.
They cannot be warded off by force of arms. They climb the wall. They fill the streets,
and enter by force into the houses. Peal locusts are not dangerous to towns, but
only to the fields.</p>
<p class="normal">In chap. ii. 11, every feature is against the literal explanation.
&quot;And the Lord giveth His voice before His army; for His camp is very numerous, for
he is strong that executeth His word; for the day of the Lord is great and very
terrible, who can comprehend it?&quot; There is not the remotest analogy in favour of
the supposition which would represent an army of locusts as the host and camp of
God, at the head of which He <span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span> Himself marches
as a general, and before which He causes His thunders to resound like trumpets.
It is true that, in some Arabic writer, this is mentioned as a Mosaic command: &quot;You
shall not kill locusts, for they are the host of God, the Most High;&quot; see <i>Bochart</i>
ii. p. 482, ed. <i>Rosenmüller</i> iii. p. 318. But who does not see that this sentence
owes its origin to the passage under consideration? Is. xiii. 2-5, where the Lord
marches at the head of a great army to destroy the whole earth, may here be compared;
and on Joel ii. 10, &quot;Before him the earth quaketh, the heavens tremble, the sun
and the moon mourn, and the stars withdraw their shining,&quot; Is xiii. 10 and Jer.
iv. 28 may be compared, where, in the view of threatening hostile inundation, the
earth laments, and the heavens above mourn.</p>
<p class="normal">In ii. 17, &quot;Give not Thine heritage to reproach, <i>that the heathen
should rule over them</i>&quot; (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501; &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;</span>),
the prophet drops the figure altogether, and allows the reality&mdash;the devastation
of the country by heathen enemies&mdash;to appear in all its nakedness. (It is worthy
of notice that by the term <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;</span> in this verse,
our remarks on <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;</span> in ii. 6 receive a confirmation.)
The defenders of the literal explanation have tried a twofold mode of escaping from
this difficulty. <i>Michaelis</i> explains thus: &quot;Spare Thy people, and deliver
them from that plague of locusts. For if they should continue to swarm any longer,
the greatest famine would arise, and Thy people, in order to satisfy the cravings
of hunger, would be compelled to flee into the territories of heathen nations to
serve them for bread, and to submit not only to their sway, but to ignominy.&quot; But
every one must at once see how far-fetched this explanation is. In all history we
do not find any instance in which a devastation by locusts&mdash;which affects the produce
of one year only, and even this never completely and throughout the whole country&mdash;has
reduced a people to the necessity of placing themselves under the dominion of foreign
nations. Modern interpreters&mdash;and especially <i>Credner</i>&mdash;take refuge in another
explanation: &quot;Give not up Thine heritage to the mockery of heathens over them.&quot;
They assert that the signification &quot;to mock&quot; is required by the parallelism. But
we cannot see how, and why. The ignominy of Israel consisted just in this, that
they, the heritage of the Lord, were brought under the dominion of the Gentiles,
It is Just by the parallelism that the signification &quot;to rule&quot; is required. For
it is the heritage <span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span> of the Lord, and the dominion
of the Gentiles, which form a striking contrast, and not their mockery. The very
same contrast is implied in ver. 18, in the words: &quot;Then the Lord was jealous for
His land.&quot; In these, the prophet reports the manner in which the Lord put away that
glaring contradiction. They are not natural locusts, but only the heathen enemies,
who can be the objects of the jealousy of the Lord; <i>His</i> land. <i>His</i>
people, He cannot give up as a prey to heathen nations. But <i>further</i>&mdash;and this
alone is sufficient to settle the question&mdash;the explanation is altogether unphilological.
The verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;</span> never has the signification &quot;to
mock;&quot; the phrase <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500; &#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</span>, &quot;to form
a proverb,&quot; is altogether peculiar to Ezekiel, in whose prophecies it several times
occurs. In the other books, nothing occurs which would be, even in the smallest
degree, to the purpose, except that in the ancient language of the Pentateuch
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span> occurs once, in Num. xxi. 27, in the
signification &quot;poets.&quot; The verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;</span> with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> means always, and without exception, &quot;to
rule over&quot;&mdash;properly, &quot;to rule by entering into any one.&quot; Thus it occurs especially
in that passage which the prophet had in view, Deut. xv. 5, 6: &quot;If thou wait hearken
unto the voice of Jehovah thy God ... thou shalt rule over many nations, and they
shall not rule over thee,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1489;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488;
&#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;</span>. Compare also the very similar passages, Ps. cvi. 41: &quot;And He gave
them into the hand of the heathen, and they that hated them ruled over them,&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1501;</span>; and Lament, v. 8: &quot;Servants rule
over us,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;</span>. That it is from prejudice
alone that the selection of the signification &quot;to mock&quot; can be accounted for, appears
also from the circumstance that all the old Translators (the LXX., <i>Jonath.</i>,
<i>Syr.</i>, <i>Vulg.</i>) render it by &quot;to rule.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">More than one proof is offered by ver. 20: &quot;And I will remove
from you the Northman, and will drive him into the land dry and desolate; his van
into the fore sea, and his rear into the hinder sea; and his stench shall come up,
and his ill-savour shall arise, for he has magnified to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">1. If we understand this literally, and refer it to real locusts,
then the designation by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;</span>, <i>i.e.</i>,
&quot;one from the North,&quot; &quot;a Northman,&quot; is inexplicable. It is true that there is no
foundation for the common assertion, that locusts move only from the South to the
North (compare <i>Credner</i>, S. 284); but in all history there is not one instance
known of locusts having come <span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span> to Palestine
from the North&mdash;from Syria. But even although occasionally single swarms, after having
come to Syria from their native country, the hot and dry South, may have strayed
thence to Palestine, such is not conceivable of so enormous a swarm as is here described,
which, with youthful strength, devastated the whole of Palestine from one end to
the other. Is it, moreover, probable that the prophet, who, as we have already seen,
prophesies things future, would mention a circumstance so accidental as the transient
abode of a swarm of locusts in Syria? Such a residence, <i>besides</i>, would not
justify the assertion. The termination <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1460;&#1470;&#1497;</span>
added to common names, indicates origin and descent. An inhabitant of a town, for
example, who should reside for a short time in a village, could not for that reason
be called a <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;</span>.&mdash;<i>Finally</i>&mdash;The native
country of the real locusts is plainly enough indicated by the words: &quot;And I will
drive him into the land dry and desolate.&quot; Who does not see that, by these words,
the hot and dry southern countries are marked out, and that the prophet expresses
the thought, &quot;The enemies will be driven back to the place whence they came,&quot; by
mentioning the country from which the real locusts used to come? Our opponents are
here greatly embarrassed. Some explain: &quot;The locusts marching northward,&quot;&mdash;<i>Hezel</i>
and <i>Justi</i>, without the slightest countenance from the <i>usus loquendi</i>:
&quot;The dark and fearful host.&quot; This opinion was approved of by <i>Gesenius</i> in
the <i>Thesaurus</i>; but in opposition to it <i>Hitzig</i> may be compared, who
himself gives the explanation, &quot;The Typhonic.&quot; <i>V. Cöln</i> (<i>de Joelis aetate</i>,
Marb. 1811, p. 10). <i>Ewald</i> and <i>Meier</i> propose a change in the text.
With the reasons preventing us from referring the expression to the locusts In a
literal sense, we may combine the fact that the North is constantly mentioned as
the native land of the most dangerous enemies of Israel, viz., the Assyrians and
Chaldeans. And although this designation be. In a geographical point of view. Inaccurate,
this is outweighed by the circumstance, that enemies always Invaded Palestine from
Syria, after having previously made that land a part of their dominions. Compare
Zeph. ii. 13: &quot;And the Lord stretches out His hand over the <i>North</i>, and destroys
Assyria, and makes Nineveh a desolation&mdash;a dry wilderness;&quot; Jer. i. 14: &quot;And the
Lord said unto me, Out of the <i>North</i> the evil shall break forth upon all the
inhabitants of the land;&quot; Jer. iii. 18, where <span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>
the land of the North is mentioned as the land of the captivity of Judah and Israel;
Jer. iv. 6, vi. 1, 22, x. 22, xlvi. 24, where the people of the North form the antithesis
to Egypt, the African power; and Zech. ii. 10. <i>Jerome</i> long ago remarked:
&quot;The prophet mentions the North, that we might not think of real locusts, which
are wont to come from the South, but might, by the locusts, understand the Assyrians
and Chaldeans.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">2. That we have here to do with a poetical description, and not
with one of natural history, appears from a designation of the places to which the
locusts are to be driven. Among these, the dry and hot southern country&mdash;the Arabian
desert&mdash;is first mentioned; then, the anterior sea, <i>i.e.</i>, the Dead Sea, situated
eastward of Jerusalem; and lastly, the hinder, or Mediterranean Sea. That, according
to the view of the prophet, the dispersion in these different directions was to
take place in a moment, appears from the circumstance that, according to his description,
the van of the same army is driven into one sea, and the rear, into the other sea.
Now, every one very easily sees that this is a physical impossibility, inasmuch
as opposite winds cannot blow at the same time. <i>Credner&#39;s</i> explanation, according
to which the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span> of the locusts is intended
to be the swarm of those who first invaded Palestine, while
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1493;</span> is their brood, deserves mention in so
far only as it affords a proof of the greatness of the absurdities into which one
may be deluded, after he has once adopted a groundless hypothesis.</p>
<p class="normal">3. The words, &quot;For he has magnified to do,&quot; state the reason of
the destruction of the locusts. They are <i>punished</i> in this manner, because
they have <i>committed sin</i> by their proud haughtiness. Because they have magnified
to do, the Lord now magnifies Himself to do against them, ver. 21; He glorifies
Himself in their destruction, since, at the time of their power, they glorified
themselves, and trampled God under foot. But sin and punishment necessarily imply
responsibility; and it would be indeed difficult to prove that, in the way of a
poetical figure, any prophet would ascribe such to irrational creatures; while,
as regards the heathen enemies of Israel, the thought here expressed is of constant
occurrence.</p>
<p class="normal">In chap. ii. 25, &quot;And I restore to you the years (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1513;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>)
which the locusts have eaten,&quot; etc., <i>several</i> years of calamity are spoken
of. But we cannot agree with <i>Ewald</i> in thinking that <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 320]</span> the land was, for several years, laid waste by locusts: we are prevented
from doing so by the single word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;</span> in chap.
i. 4. <i>Bochart</i> rightly remarks: &quot;The produce of the new year cannot be called
the residue of the former year. That word is much more applicable to the fruits
of some fields, which are passed by, or to the residue left in a field, which should
be eaten up in the same year.&quot; As little can we suppose, with <i>Ewald</i>, that
the plural is here used with reference to the effects produced, by the devastation
of one year, upon the ensuing years; for it is not a possible loss which is here
spoken of, but one which has actually taken place. The prophet then passes, here
also, from the image to the thing itself,&mdash;to the hostile invasions extending over
longer periods, which he describes under the image of a devastation by locusts which,
at one time, took place.</p>
<p class="normal">Very strong arguments in favour of the figurative explanation
are furnished, in addition, by chap. iv. (iii.). The whole announcement of punishment
and judgment upon the heathen nations has sense and meaning, only when, in the preceding
context, there has been mention made of the crime which they committed against the
Lord and His people. In that case, we have before us the three main subjects of
prophecy,&mdash;God&#39;s judgments upon His people by heathen enemies, their obtaining mercy,
and the punishment of the enemies. At the very beginning of chap. iv. (iii.) the
sufferings of Israel, described in chap. i. and ii., and the judgment upon the heathen,
are brought into the closest connection. According to chap. iv. 1, 2, the gathering
of the Gentiles is to take place at a time when the Lord will return to the captivity
of Judah and Jerusalem, <i>i.e.</i>, according to the constant <i>usus loquendi</i>
(compare my Commentary on Ps. xiv. 7), when He will grant them, mercy, and deliver
them from their misery.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_320a" href="#ftn_320a">[1]</a></sup>
But that this misery can be none other than that described in chap. i. and ii. appears
simply from the fact, that this has been declared to be the close of all the judgments
of God.&mdash;We must, <i>further</i>, not overlook the article <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 321]</span> in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;</span> in chap. iv.
2, and, accordingly, must not translate, &quot;I will gather all nations,&quot; but &quot;all
<i>the</i> nations.&quot; And how could this be explained in any other way than&mdash;all the
nations which are spoken of in the preceding chapters under the image of locusts?
But of special importance is the second part of the verse: &quot;And I plead there with
them concerning My people, and My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among
the nations, and distributed My land.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_321a" href="#ftn_321a">[2]</a></sup>
It is quite impossible that there should here be the mention of anything which happened
before the time of Joel. Whatever period we may assign to him, he belongs, at all
events, to a time in which a scattering of Israel among the Gentiles, and a distribution
of their land, had not as yet taken place. <i>Credner</i>, indeed, believes that
the calamities under Jehoram are sufficient to account for these expressions. &quot;At
that time,&quot; he says, &quot;the Edomites revolted from Judah; Libnah, which belonged to
Judah In the stricter sense, rebelled; the Arabs and Philistines invaded the kingdom
and plundered its capital; those inroads did then not terminate without a diminution
of the territory of Judah.&quot; But all this is irrelevant; the discourse concerns the
distribution of the land of the <i>Lord</i>. The rebellion of a heathen tributary
people does not, therefore, here come under consideration. Just as little can we
see what Libnah has to do here. It belonged, it is true, to the kingdom of Judah;
but the heathen nations had nothing to do with its rebellion;&mdash;for this, according
to 2 Kings viii. 22, and 2 Chron. xxi. 10, proceeded from the inhabitants, who were
dissatisfied with the bad government of the king, and was speedily brought to a
close. It cannot then be proved, that even some small portion of the territory was
lost at that time; far less, that the whole country was apportioned anew. It is
quite the same as regards the dispersion among the Gentiles. The invasion of the
Philistines cannot <span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span> here come into consideration,
because, in ver. 4, these enemies are expressly distinguished from those who had
effected the dispersion of the people, and the distribution of the land: &quot;And ye
also, what have ye to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the borders of Palestine?&quot;
The prophet can thus not be speaking of something which had taken place at his time;
but as little can he speak of something still future, which had not been touched
upon by him when he threatened punishment upon the Covenant-people; for the devastation
by the locusts appears as the highest and last calamity of the future. Nothing,
therefore, remains but to suppose, that under the image of the devastation by locusts,
the devastation of the country by heathen enemies, and the dispersion of its inhabitants,
are described,&mdash;a supposition which is confirmed by the great resemblance of the
passage under consideration to chap. ii. 17-19. <i>Vatke</i> (<i>Theol. des A. Th.</i>
i. S. 462) founded upon the fact that the general exile is here predicted, the assertion
that Joel had prophesied only after the captivity. No one, of course, has been willing
to agree with him in this; but as long as the devastation by the locusts is understood
literally, it will not be possible to undermine the grounds upon which he supports
his views. It is altogether in vain that people spend their labour in disputing
the fact, so obvious and evident, that the discourse here concerns the total occupation
of the land by the heathen, the total carrying away of its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="normal">It may be further remarked, that this passage at the same time
considerably strengthens the proof already adduced, that Joel foretells future things
in chap. i. and ii. A devastation by the locusts is described in these chapters;
but the substance of this figure does not refer to the time of Joel.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Finally</i>&mdash;We must still direct attention to the words in
iv. 17:&mdash;And Jerusalem shall be a sanctuary, and there shall no strangers pass through
her any more.&quot; This promise stands in evident contrast to the former threatening,
and becomes intelligible only by it. In it, therefore, the <i>strangers</i> must
be represented under the figure of the locusts.</p>
<p class="normal">And now, after all these single proofs have been enumerated&mdash;proofs
which, if necessary, might easily have been strengthened and increased&mdash;let us look
back to this survey of the contents of the book, and we shall see how, according
to our view, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span> and according to it alone, the
prophecy of Joel forms an harmonious, complete, and well finished whole, and that
the prophet adheres closely to the outlines already given by Moses, with the filling
up and finishing of which all other prophets also are employed. And let us, finally,
add, that exegetical tradition also bears a favourable testimony to the figurative
interpretation.</p>
<p class="normal">We need not spend much time in considering the arguments advanced
against the figurative interpretation by <i>Credner</i> (S. 27 ff.), <i>Hitzig</i>,
and others. They all rest upon an almost incomprehensible ignoring of the nature
of poetry, of the metaphor, and of the allegory. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Credner</i>
says, &quot;What man of sound sense will ever be able to say of horses, horsemen and
warriors, that they resemble horses and horsemen? Who has ever seen horses and horsemen
climbing over walls? What shall we say concerning chap. ii. 20? Do land armies ever
perish in the sea, and, moreover, in two different seas? What is the use of foretelling,
in chap. ii. 22, 23, the ceasing of the drought, if the prophet here thought of
real enemies?&quot; But in opposition to all these and similar objections, let us simply
keep in mind, that the prophet does not by any means view the enemies as such, and
only incidentally compares them with locusts; but that in his inward vision they
represented themselves to him as locusts. It is just the characteristic feature
of the allegory, that the image becomes in it substantial, and has the thing represented,
not <i>beside</i> it, but <i>in</i>, <i>with</i>, and <i>under</i> it. But it is
just for this reason that many a feature must be introduced which does not belong
to the <i>real</i> subject, <i>i.e.</i>, the figure, but to the <i>ideal</i> only,
<i>i.e.</i>, the thing represented thereby. It is for this very reason also, that
the metaphor, raised to the <i>ideal</i> subject, may again be compared with the
<i>real</i> subject. After all this we may well judge what right <i>Ewald</i> has
to call the figurative explanation &quot;an error, which, in consideration of our present
knowledge, becomes from day to day less pardonable.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">We remark further, that, in chap. i. 4, it is distinctly indicated
that Israel&#39;s visitation by the world&#39;s power will not be a simple one, but will
present various aspects: &quot;That which the <i>gnawer</i> has left, the <i>locust</i>
devoureth; and that which the <i>locust</i> hath left, the <i>licker</i> devoureth;
and that which the <i>licker</i> hath left, the <i>eater</i> devoureth.&quot; The opinion
has been entertained, that &quot;the prophet does not say, one cloud of locusts after
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span> another, or swarms of locusts of every description
have come up; but, on the contrary, that they are all contemporary, and that all
of them devour the same things.&quot; But a succession is quite obvious. The four parties
do not devour at the same time; but the second devours what the first has left.
It is true that the succession appears as very rapid; but that is a peculiarity
belonging only to the vision. If there be <i>at all</i> a succession of those extensive
empires representing the world&#39;s power, there must in reality be considerable intervals
between them. The question then arises, however, whether the number <i>four</i>
is to be considered as a round number, so that the thought would only be this, that
several nations are to visit the people of the Lord, or whether, on the contrary,
importance is to be attached to the number <i>four</i> as such. According to <i>
Jerome</i>, the Jews followed the latter view. In accordance with their view, the
first swarm denotes the Assyrians, together with the Chaldeans; the second, the
Medo-Persians; the third, the Grecian kingdoms; the fourth, the Romans. The analogies
of the four horns in Zech. ii. 1-4 (i. 18-21), the four beasts in Daniel, the seven
heads of the beast in Revelation&mdash;denoting the seven phases of the world&#39;s power
opposed to God&mdash;are decisive in favour of the latter view; compare my <i>Commentary
on Rev.</i> xii. 18, xiii. 1. Now, if we follow this view at all, we must, in determining
the four swarms, certainly assent to the opinion of the Jews, as given in <i>Jerome</i>;
and this so much the more, as the four swarms are, in that case, exactly parallel
to the four beasts in Daniel, which denote the Chaldean, Medo-Persian, Grecian,
and Roman monarchies. The fact that the Assyrians are taken together with the Chaldeans
can be the less strange, because, so early as in the prophecy of Balaam, Asshur
and Babylon are comprehended under the common name
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, &quot;that which is on the other
side,&quot;&mdash;the power on the other side of the Euphrates; and are contrasted with the
new empire which pressed on from the West&mdash;from Europe. (Compare my <i>Dissertation
on Balaam</i>, p. 593 ff.)<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_324a" href="#ftn_324a">[3]</a></sup>
It was the less possible to ascribe to the Assyrians an independent position here,
as Joel has to do mainly with Judah, upon which no judgment of real importance was
inflicted by the Assyrians.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>And, ye sons of Zion, exult and rejoice in Jehovah your God;
for He giveth you the Teacher of righteousness, and then He poureth down upon you
rain, the former rain and the latter rain, for the first time.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;In Jehovah your God,&quot; are an addition peculiar to
the sons of Zion. In reference to the <i>earth</i>, which the locusts had devastated,
it was in ver. 21 said only, &quot;Fear not, exult and rejoice.&quot; In reference to the
beasts, <i>i.e.</i>, to the heathen world, which was kept in subjection by the conquerors
of the world, but which is delivered by the great deeds of the Lord, it is in ver.
22 said only: &quot;Fear not.&quot; They are only the sons of Zion who know and love the Author
of Salvation, and who receive from Him special gifts, besides the general ones.</p>
<p class="normal">There is considerable difference in the interpretations of this
verse. The words, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span>, are, by
the greater number of interpreters, translated, &quot;The Teacher of righteousness.&quot;
Thus, <i>Jonathan</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i>, <i>Jarchi</i>, <i>Abarbanel</i>, <i>Grotius</i>,
and almost all the interpreters of the early Lutheran Church translate them. Others
take <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> in the signification of &quot;rain,&quot;
and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span> as qualifying its nature more accurately.
Even in ancient times, this explanation was not at all uncommon. Among the Rabbinical
interpreters, it was held by <i>Kimchi</i>, <i>Abenezra</i>, <i>S. B. Melech</i>,
who explain it of a <i>timely</i> rain. <i>Calvin</i>, who rendered the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span> by <i>justa mensura</i>, defends it
with great decision, and declares the other explanations to be forced, and unsuitable
to the connection. It is translated by &quot;rain&quot; in the English<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_325a" href="#ftn_325a">[1]</a></sup>
and Genevan versions, and by many Calvinistic interpreters, who differ, however,
in the translation of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span>, and render it
either: &quot;In right time,&quot; or &quot;in right measure,&quot; or &quot;in the right place,&quot; or &quot;for
His righteousness,&quot; or &quot;according to your righteousness.&quot; <i>Marckius</i> is of
opinion that &quot;rain&quot; is necessarily required by the context; but that, on account
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span>, this rain must be understood spiritually
of the Messiah with His saving doctrine, and His Spirit. Among the interpreters
of the Lutheran Church, <i>Seb. Schmid</i> thinks of &quot;a rain in due season.&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span> Among modern interpreters, the explanation
by &quot;rain&quot; has become altogether so prevalent, that it is considered scarcely of
any importance even to mention the other. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span>
is explained by <i>Eckermann</i>: &quot;In proof of His good pleasure;&quot; by <i>Ewald</i>,
<i>Meier</i>, and <i>Umbreit</i>: &quot;For justification;&quot; by <i>Justi</i>: &quot;For fruitfulness;&quot;
and by the others (<i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Holzhausen</i>, <i>Credner</i>, <i>Rückert</i>,
<i>Maurer</i>, and <i>Hitzig</i>) by: &quot;In right measure.&quot; We consider this explanation
to be decidedly erroneous, and the other to be the sound one; and this for the following
reasons:&mdash;1. The great difference, on the part of the defenders of the current opinion,
as regards the explanation of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span> certainly
indicates, with sufficient clearness, that, by this addition, a considerable obstruction
is put in its way. The most current explanation, by &quot;<i>justa mensura</i>,&quot; &quot;in
right measure,&quot; &quot;sufficiently,&quot; is certainly quite untenable. Even the fact, that
it is not <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;</span> but
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span> which is used here, must excite suspicion.
(On the difference betwixt these two words, compare <i>Ewald</i> in the first edition
of his Grammar, S. 312-13.) But what is quite decisive is the fact that these two
words, which occur with such extraordinary frequency, are never found in a physical,
but always in a moral sense only. The only passage in which, according to <i>Winer</i>,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;</span> signifies &quot;rectitude&quot; in a physical sense,
is Ps. xxiii. 3: <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;</span> which, according
to him, means: &quot;Straight, right ways.&quot; But that verse runs thus: &quot;He restoreth my
soul, He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name&#39;s sake.&quot; The path
is a spiritual one; it is righteousness itself, which consists in the actual declaration
of being just, and in justification, which are implied in the gift of salvation.
With regard to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;</span>, <i>Holzhausen</i> (S.
120) maintains that it is used of a measure which has its due size in Lev. xix.
35, 36. The words are these: &quot;Ye shall not do <i>unrighteousness</i> in judgment,
in measure, in division. Balances of righteousness, weights of righteousness, ephas
of righteousness, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the
land of Egypt.&quot; Even the contrast&mdash;so evident&mdash;with the <i>unrighteousness</i>, shows
distinctly that balances, measures, and weights of righteousness are here such as
belong to righteousness&mdash;are in harmony with it. Even the root
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;</span> never occurs in a physical sense, but
always, only in a moral sense. To this it must be added, that the explanation, &quot;Teacher
of righteousness,&quot; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span> is recommended by the parallel
passage in Hos. x. 12, where, also, teaching occurs in connection with righteousness:
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;</span>, &quot;And the Lord will come and
teach you righteousness.&quot; This parallel passage is also opposed to <i>Ewald&#39;s</i>
explanation, &quot;for justification,&quot;&mdash;the only explanation among those mentioned to
which, it must be admitted, no philological objection can be raised. But the thought,
&quot;The early rain an actual justification of Israel,&quot; would be rather strange, and
so much the more so, because the wrath of God had not manifested itself in a drought
and want of water, but rather in the sending of the army of locusts.</p>
<p class="normal">2. That the giving of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span>,
in the first hemistich of the verse, must denote a divine blessing different from
the giving of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> in the second, is evident
for this reason:&mdash;that, otherwise, there would arise a somewhat meaningless tautology.
They who assigned to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> in the first hemistich,
the signification of &quot;rain in general,&quot; have felt how very unsuitable is the twofold
mention of the early rain. To this must be added the use of the <i>Fut.</i> with
<i>Vav convers.</i>, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;</span>. By this form,
an action is denoted which <i>follows</i> from the preceding one; but according
to the current explanation, one and the same action would here be expressed, only
in different words. It cannot be denied, indeed, that the form occurs by no means
rarely in a weakened sense, and is used only to express a connection; and that for
this reason, this argument is not, <i>per se</i>, conclusive. Yet the original signification
so generally holds, that we can abandon it only for distinct and forcible reasons.
In addition to this, it must be considered that the addition of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1513;&#1501;</span> to the second
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> distinctly marks out the latter as being
different in its meaning from the former. It must also be kept in mind that it is
one of the peculiarities of Joel to use the same words and phrases, after brief
intervals, in a different sense; compare <i>Credner&#39;s</i> remarks on ii. 20, iii.
5.</p>
<p class="normal">3. The explanation by &quot;Teacher&quot; is far more obvious for the reason
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> always occurs with the signification
of &quot;teacher&quot; (even in Ps. lxxxiv. 7, where the right translation is: &quot;With blessing
also the teacher covereth himself&quot;), and never with that of &quot;rain,&quot; or &quot;early rain.&quot;
This is rather the meaning of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span>; and the
verb also never occurs in <i>Hiphil</i>, as it does in <i>Kal</i>, with the signification
&quot;to sprinkle,&quot; &quot;to water.&quot; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span> By this we are
led to the supposition that Joel, in the second hemistich, made use of the uncommon
form <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> with the meaning of &quot;early rain,&quot;
solely on account of the resemblance of the sound to the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> occurring immediately before, with its
usual signification; and that, at the same time, he added
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1513;&#1501;</span> for the purpose of avoiding ambiguity.
What serves to confirm this supposition, is the circumstance that Jeremiah, alluding
to the passage under consideration, has, in chap. v. 24, put
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> in the place of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span>; which proves that the second
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> in Joel ii. 23 has originated only from
its connection with the first, which is altogether wanting in Jeremiah.</p>
<p class="normal">4. A causal connection, similar to that which exists here betwixt
the sending of the Teacher of righteousness and the pouring out of the rain, occurs
also in that passage of the Pentateuch which the prophet seems to have had in view,
viz., Deut. xi. 13, 14: &quot;And it shall come to pass, <i>if ye shall hearken unto
my commandments</i> which I command you this day, that ye love the Lord your God,
and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give you the
rain of your land in due season, the first rain and the latter rain (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;
&#1493;&#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;</span>), and thou shalt gather in thy corn, and thy must, and thine oil.&quot;
Here, as well as there, the righteousness of the people is the <i>antecedens</i>;
the divine mercies and blessings are the <i>consequens</i>. Since the former does
not exist, God begins the course of His mercies by sending Him who calls it forth.
This remark removes, at the same time, the objection, that the mention of the Teacher
of righteousness is unsuitable in a connection where the prophet speaks of temporal
blessings only, and rises to spiritual blessings only afterwards, in chap. iii.
There existed for the Covenant-people no benefits which were purely temporal; these
were always, at the same time, signs and pledges of the divine favour, which depended
upon the righteousness of the people, and this, in turn, upon the divine mission
of a Teacher of righteousness.</p>
<p class="normal">5. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1503;</span> is also in
favour of our explanation. It stands in close relation to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;</span> in chap. iii. 1, ii. 28. The sending
of the Teacher of righteousness has two consequences;&mdash;<i>first</i>, the pouring
out of the temporal rain&mdash;an individualizing designation of every kind of outward
blessings, and chosen with a reference to the passage of the Pentateuch which we
have just <span class="pagenum">[Pg 329]</span> cited, but with special reference
to the description of the calamity, under the figure of a devastation by locusts;&mdash;and,
<i>secondly</i>, the outpouring of the spiritual rain&mdash;the sending of the Holy Ghost.
It needs only the pointing out of this reference, which has been overlooked by interpreters,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_329a" href="#ftn_329a">[2]</a></sup>
to set aside the manifold and different explanations of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1503;</span> which are, all of them, unphilological,
or give an unsuitable sense.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_329b" href="#ftn_329b">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">But if any doubt should still remain, it would be removed by a
parallel passage in Isaiah, which depends upon the text under review, in a manner
not to be mistaken, and which, therefore, must be regarded as the oldest commentary
upon it. Isaiah is describing the condition of the people subsequent to their having
obtained mercy, after a long time of deep misery, in chap. xxx 20: &quot;And the Lord
gives you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction; and then thy <i>teacher</i>
(<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;</span> is <i>singular</i>) shall no longer
hide himself, and thine eyes shall see thy teacher; Ver. 21: And thine ears hear
a word behind thee, This is the way, walk ye in it; do not turn to the right hand,
nor to the left.&quot; Accordingly, after they have put away what was evil, ver. 22:
&quot;The Lord giveth the rain of thy seed, with which thou sowest thy land,&quot; etc., ver.
23. The teacher is not a human teacher, but God. <i>Human</i> teachers had not concealed
themselves; but that the Lord had concealed Himself, is affirmed in the preceding
verses. The words, &quot;Behind thee&quot; (ver. 21), suggest the idea of a teacher of such
a glory that they could not look in his face (compare Rev. i. 10); and the words,
&quot;Thine eyes see thy teacher,&quot; ver. 20, imply the idea of the high majesty of the
teacher, and suggest the idea of a revelation of the glory of the Lord; compare
Is. xl. 5, lii. 8. The Lord must first manifest Himself as a Teacher, before He
appears as a Saviour. In Isaiah, the Lord Himself appears as the Teacher; as also
in Hos. x. 12: &quot;It is time to seek the Lord, till He <span class="pagenum">[Pg 330]</span>
come and teach you righteousness;&quot; while in Joel, on the contrary, it is the Lord
who giveth the Teacher. Both may be reconciled by the consideration, that in the
Teacher whom the Lord gives, the glory of the Lord becomes manifest.</p>
<p class="normal">It now only remains to inquire who is to be understood by the
Teacher of righteousness. (Teacher of righteousness is equivalent to: &quot;Teaching
them how they should fear the Lord,&quot; 2 Kings xvii. 28.) It is referred to the Messiah,
not only by almost all those Christian interpreters who follow this explanation,
with the exception of <i>Grotius</i>, who conjectures that Isaiah or some other
prophet is to be thereby understood; but also, after the example of <i>Jonathan</i>,
by several Jewish commentators; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Abarbanel</i>, who says: &quot;This teacher
of righteousness, however, is the King Messiah, who will show the way in which we
must walk, and the works which we must do.&quot; Even on account of the article, it is
not possible to refer it to a single human teacher; and this argument may, at the
same time, be added to those which oppose the explanation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> by &quot;an early rain.&quot; There can be only
the choice betwixt the Messiah as the long promised Teacher
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>, and the <i>ideal</i> teacher,&mdash;the
collective body of all divine teachers. But the latter view requires to be somewhat
raised, before it can be allowed to enter into the competition. That we have not
here before us an ordinary collective body, is shown by the parallel passage in
Isaiah, according to which the glory of the Lord is to be manifested in the Teacher.
And this is as little applicable to a plurality of human teachers, as to a single
individual. It is <i>further</i> proved by the fundamental passage in Deut. xviii.
18, 19, where, indeed, the prophetic order is comprehended in an <i>ideal</i> person.
This, however, has its reason only in the circumstance, that the idea of prophetism
was, at some future time, to find its realization in a <i>real</i> person. It is
<i>further</i> seen from the state of the Messianic hopes at the time of Joel, and
from the exceeding greatness of what is here connected with the appearance of the
Teacher of righteousness. In addition to the allusion in Gen. xlix. 10 and Deut.
xviii., the Messiah appears as a Teacher in the Song of Solomon also, chap. viii.
2; and in Is. lv. 4: &quot;Behold, I give Him for a witness to the people, for a prince
and a lawgiver to the people;&quot; as also in those passages of the second part of Isaiah,
in which He is declared to be the Prophet <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span> When thus understood, the explanation of the
<i>ideal</i> teacher may be preferable to the reference to Christ exclusively. In
favour of such a reference, there is the comprehensive character and the <i>ideal</i>
import which are, in general, peculiar to the prophecies of Joel. Such a reference
is, moreover, favoured by the expression itself, which points out only that which
Christ has in common with the former servants of God, viz., the teaching of righteousness,
and especially by a comparison with the fundamental passages, Deut. xviii.</p>

<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>And it shall come to pass, afterwards, I will pour
out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; your
old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The communication of the Spirit of God was the constant prerogative
of the Covenant-people. Indeed, the very idea of such a people necessarily requires
it. For the Spirit of God is the only inward bond betwixt Him and that which is
created; a Covenant-people, therefore, without such an inward connection, is an
impossibility. As a constant possession of the Covenant-people, the Spirit of God
appears in Isaiah lxiii. 11, where the people, in the condition of the deepest abandonment,
say, in the remembrance of the divine mercies, &quot;Where is He that put His Holy Spirit
within him?&quot; But it was peculiar to the nature of the Old Testament dispensation,
that the effusion of the Spirit of God was less rich. His effects less powerful,
and a participation in them less general. It was only after God&#39;s relation to the
world had been changed by the death of Christ that the Spirit of <i>Christ</i> could
be bestowed,&mdash;a higher power of the Spirit of God, standing to Him in the same relation
as the Angel of the Lord to the incarnate Word. The conditions of the bestowal of
the Holy Spirit were, under the Old Testament, far more difficult to obtain. The
view of Christ in His historical personality, in His life, suffering, and death,
was wanting. God, although infinitely nearer to the Jews than to the Gentiles, yet
ever remained a God relatively <span class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</span> distant. Since
the procuring cause of the mercy of God&mdash;the merit of Christ&mdash;was not yet so clearly
seen, it was far more difficult to lay hold of it, and the by-path of legalism was
far nearer. It was thus only upon a few&mdash;especially upon the prophets&mdash;that the direct
possession of the Spirit of God was concentrated; while the greater number, even
among those of a better disposition, enjoyed a spiritual life derived only from
a union with them, and hence it was less strong. It arose from the nature of the
case that, at some future time, there must take place a richer and more powerful
effusion of the Spirit of God; and it was just for this reason that it was the desire
of Moses, that such might take place, and that the whole people might prophesy.
Num. xi. 29, besides expressing such a desire, is, at the same time, a prophecy.
He wished nothing else than that the people of God might attain to such a degree
as to realize the idea of a people of God; and this must come to pass at some future
time, because the omnipotent and faithful God could not leave His work unfinished.
But Moses himself immediately subjoins the prophecy to the wish, as a clear proof,
that behind the wish the prophecy is concealed: &quot;Would God that all the Lord&#39;s people
were prophets! for the Lord will give His Spirit upon them,&quot; etc.; which is equivalent
to: &quot;At some future time, the whole people of the Lord shall be prophets, not against,
but agreeably to, my wish; for,&quot; etc. It is this promise of Moses which is here
resumed by Joel, with whom, subsequently. Is. in chap. xxxii. 15, &quot;Until the Spirit
be poured upon us from on high;&quot; chap. xi. 9, liv. 13; Jer. xxxi. 33, 34; Ezek.
xxxvi. 26 ff., and Zech. xii. 10, connect themselves. The ultimate reference of
the promise is to the Messianic time; but the reference to the preparatory steps
must not, for this reason, be by any means excluded. The announcement of the pouring
out of the Spirit rests upon the insight into the nature of God&#39;s relation to His
kingdom. God&#39;s judgments, in which He draws near to His people, in which the abstract
God becomes a concrete God, excite in the people a longing for a union with Him.
Teachers sent by God give a right direction to this longing, and then an outpouring
of the Spirit takes place. This proceeding does, and must continually, repeat itself
in the history of the Covenant-people. The perfect fulfilment at the time of Christ
could <span class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</span> not at all have taken place, unless
the imperfect fulfilment had already pervaded their whole earlier history; and that
there is, in the prophecy under consideration, no reference at all to such imperfect
fulfilments, could be maintained only, if there existed in the text any hint that
the prophet intended to speak of only the last realization of the idea. But as the
exclusion of all the preliminary stages is entirely arbitrary, it is just as arbitrary
to separate, from the events which make up the main fulfilment in the Messianic
time, one particular event, viz., that which took place on the first day of Pentecost.
It is only to a certain extent that we can affirm that the prophecy found its final
fulfilment in this event, viz., in as far as it formed the pledge of it,&mdash;in as far
as the whole succeeding development and progress were already contained in it,&mdash;in
as far as Joel&#39;s prophecy in words was then changed into an infinitely more powerful
prophecy in deeds. It is from overlooking the relation of the prophecy to the thought
which animates it, and from the error arising from this, viz., that the fulfilment
must necessarily fall within a particular, limited period, that the various opposite
interpretations had their rise (compare the copious enumeration and representation
of these in <i>Dresde</i>, <i>Comparatio Joelis de Effusione Spir. S. vatic. c.
Petrina interpret.</i> <i>Wittemb.</i> 1782, <i>Spec.</i> 2), all of which are partially
true, and are false only by their one-sidedness and exclusiveness. 1. Several interpreters
think of an event at the time of Joel. Thus Rabbi <i>Moses Hakkohen</i>, according
to <i>Abenezra</i>, <i>Teller</i> on <i>Turrettine de interpret.</i> p. 59, <i>Cramer</i>
on the <i>Scythische Denkmäler</i>, p. 221.&mdash;2. Others insist on an exclusive reference
to the first Pentecost. Thus do almost all the Fathers of the Church&mdash;among whom,
however, <i>Jerome</i> (on Joel iii. 1) felt the great difficulties in the way of
this view, arising from the context&mdash;and most of the later Christian interpreters.&mdash;3.
Others would refer it at the same time to the events in Joel&#39;s time, and to those
at the first Pentecost. Of this opinion are <i>Ephraem Syr.</i>, <i>Grotius</i>,
and <i>Turrettine</i>.&mdash;4. Others place the fulfilment altogether in the future.
Thus did the Jews as early as in the time of <i>Jerome</i>, and afterwards Jarchi,
Kimchi, and Abarbanel.&mdash;5. Others, finally, find in the first Pentecost the beginning
only of the fulfilment, and regard it as pervading the whole Christian time. Thus,
<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Calovius</i> (<i>Bibl. illustr. ad. h. l.</i>) says: &quot;Although
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</span> that prophecy began to be fulfilled in a remarkable
manner on that feast of the Pentecost, yet its reference is not to that solemn event
only, but to the whole state of these last, or New Testament times, <i>just after
the manner of other general promises</i>.&quot; These last words show that <i>Calovius</i>
was very near the truth. But if the promise be a general one, by what are we entitled
to place the beginning of its fulfilment only at the times of the New Testament,
and to exclude all of that same gift which God bestowed in Old Testament times?
The insufficiency of the foundation for such a limitation in the text itself is
proved by the following confession of <i>Dresde</i> (l. c. p. 8), who even believes
himself obliged to defend such a limitation from the authority of the Apostle Peter,
and to whom it did not at all occur, that any other reference than to some particular
event was even possible: &quot;It appears, therefore,&quot; he says, &quot;that the prophecy, considered
in itself, is so expressed, that no one, except the first author of the prophecy,
will be able convincingly to define the exact event to which it really refers.&quot;
We shall afterwards see that the testimony of the New Testament to which <i>Dresde</i>
here alludes, does not by any means demand such a limitation. We have seen that
Joel points to a fourfold oppression of Israel by the world&#39;s power. The <i>main</i>
fulfilment we must then expect at the time of the fourth; but this can scarcely
be the first fulfilment; for we cannot imagine that the former calamities should
have passed over the people altogether without effect; and the divine gift of the
Spirit goes always hand in hand with the susceptibility of the people. By proving
that fourfold oppression, we have also furnished the proof that the prophecy of
the outpouring of the Spirit has a comprehensive character.&mdash;From the already established
reference of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;</span> to the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1503;</span> in chap. ii. 23, it is obvious that
it is not so much a determination of the succession of time, as of a succession
in point of importance, which is thereby given. Among the two effects of the mission
of the Teacher of righteousness, first, the lower, and then, the higher, presents
itself to the view of the prophet. The determination of time is not the essential
point; that serves only to illustrate the internal relation of these two events,
the gradation of these divine blessings; although we are able to demonstrate that,
even as regards time, the prophecy was fulfilled in this order. For after the destruction
by the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span> Chaldeans, the temporal blessings were
restored to the people, before the main fulfilment of the promise of the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit took place; compare Ps. cvii. 33-42 with Joel ii. 25-27.&mdash;The
words, &quot;I shall pour out,&quot; refer to the rain in ver. 23. The idea of copiousness,
opposed to the former scantiness, is indeed implied in it. Yet it must not be exclusively
considered; the qualities of the rain alluded to in ver. 24 ff.&mdash;viz., the quickening
of what was previously dead, the fructifying power&mdash;must not be overlooked.&mdash;The words,
&quot;Upon all flesh,&quot; are, by most of the Jewish interpreters (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Kimchi</i>,
<i>Abenezra</i>; compare <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schöttgen</i> on Acts ii. 16, 17),
referred to the members of the Covenant-people only; but by the Christian interpreters,
whom even Abarbanel joins, to all men. So, still, does <i>Steudel</i> in the <i>
Tübinger Pfingst-Programm</i>, 1820, p. 11. But in this latter explanation, one
thing has been overlooked&mdash;as, among the older interpreters, has been well shown
by <i>Calvin</i>,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_335a" href="#ftn_335a">[1]</a></sup>
and among the more recent, by <i>Tychsen</i> (<i>progr. ad h. l.</i> p. 5)&mdash;viz.,
that the subsequent words, &quot;Your sons, your daughters, your old men, your young
men, the servants, the handmaids,&quot; contain a specification of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1512;</span>; so that the <i>all</i>, by which it is
qualified, does not do away with the limitation to a particular people, but only
with the limits of sex, age, and rank, among the people themselves. The participation
of the Gentiles in the outpouring of the Holy Ghost did not, in the first instance,
come into consideration in this place, inasmuch as the threatening of punishment,
with which the proclamation of salvation is connected, had respect to the Covenant-people
only. <i>Credner</i> has been led into a strange error, by pressing the words
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1512;</span> without any regard to the connection.
He imputes to the prophet the monstrous idea, that the Spirit of God, the fountain
of all which is good and great, well pleasing to God, and divine, is to be poured
out upon all animals also, even upon the locusts.&mdash;The foundation for the promise
of the Holy Spirit is formed by Gen. ii. 7, compared with i. 26. It supposes that
the spirit of man, as distinguished from all other living things
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span> on earth, is a breath from God.&mdash;There is here,
moreover, the same contrast betwixt <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1512;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;</span> as in Gen. vi. 3 and Is. xxxi. 3: &quot;The
Egyptians are men, and not God; their horses are flesh, and not spirit.&quot; (Compare
other passages in <i>Gesenius&#39;</i> <i>Thesaurus</i>, <i>s. v.</i> p. 249.) <i>Flesh</i>,
in this contrast, signifies human nature with respect to its weakness and helplessness;
the <i>spirit</i> is the principle of life and strength. As &quot;your sons,&quot; etc., is
a specification of all flesh, so, the words, &quot;They prophesy, they dream dreams,
they see visions,&quot; are a specification of: &quot;I pour out My Spirit.&quot; From this, it
is evident that the particular gifts do not here come into consideration according
to their individual nature, but according to that essential character which is common
to them as effects of the Spirit of God. Hence it is obvious also, that we are not
at liberty to ask why it is just to the sons and daughters that the prophesying
is ascribed, etc. The prophet, whose object it is only to individualize and expand
the fundamental thought, <i>i.e.</i>, the universality of the effects of the Spirit,
chooses for this purpose the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_336a" href="#ftn_336a">[2]</a></sup>
because these are more obvious than the ordinary ones; and from among the extraordinary
ones, again, those which were common under the Old Testament; without thereby excluding
the others, or, as regards the real import, adding anything to the declaration,
&quot;I will pour out My Spirit.&quot; This appears also from ver. 2, where, in reference
to the servants and handmaids, the expression returns to the former generality.
In distributing the gifts of the Spirit among the particular classes, the prophet
has been as little guided by any internal considerations, as, <i>e.g.</i>, Zechariah,
when in chap. ix. 17 he uses the words, &quot;Corn maketh the young men grow up, and
must, the maids.&quot; The remark made by <i>Credner</i> and <i>Hitzig</i>, after the
example of <i>Tychsen</i>, that visions are ascribed to vigorous youth, but dreams
to feebler age, appears at once, from an examination of the historical
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span> instances, and from the comparison of Num.
xii. 6, to be unfounded. &quot;Your sons and your daughters prophesy,&quot; etc., is equivalent
to: &quot;Your sons and your daughters, your old men and your young men, prophesy, have
<i>divine</i> dreams (a limitation to such is implied in their being the effects
of the outpouring of the Spirit), and see visions;&quot; and this again is equivalent
to: &quot;They will enjoy the Spirit of God, with all His gifts and blessings.&quot; In this,
and in no other way, has the passage been constantly understood among the Jews.
If it had been otherwise, how could Peter have so confidently declared the events
on the feast of Pentecost, where there occurred neither dreams nor visions, to be
a fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel? It is implied, however, in the nature of the
case, that, in the principal fulfilments of the prophecy of Joel, the extraordinary
gifts of the Spirit should be accompanied by the ordinary ones; for the former are
the witnesses and means of the latter, although, at the same time, the basis also
on which they rest; so that times like those which are described in 1 Sam. iii.
1, where the Word of God is precious in the country, and there is no prophecy spread
abroad, must necessarily be poor in the ordinary gifts of grace also. It is not
in the essence, but only in the form of manifestation, that the extraordinary gifts
differ from the ordinary ones,&mdash;just as Christ&#39;s outward miracles differ from His
inward ones.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>And upon the servants also, and upon the handmaids,
I will pour out My Spirit in those days.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Credner</i> refers this to the Hebrew prisoners of war, living
as servants and handmaids among heathen nations, far away from the Holy Land. But
if the prophet had this in view, he must necessarily have expressed himself with
greater distinctness. Moreover, the relation to the preceding verse requires that,
as the difference of sex and age was there done away with, so no allowance should
here be made for the difference of rank. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1501;</span>
shows that the extension of the gifts of the Spirit even to servants and handmaids,
who, to the carnal eye, appeared to be unworthy of such distinction, is to be considered
as something unexpected and extraordinary. That there is very little correctness
in the assertion of <i>Credner</i>, that &quot;there could have been scarcely any doubt
as regards the participation of the Hebrew <span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>
slaves,&quot; is sufficiently shown by the fact, that Jewish interpreters have attempted,
in various ways, to lessen the blessing here promised to the servants and handmaids.
Even the translation of the LXX. by, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#963; &#948;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#963;
&#956;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#963; &#948;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#945;&#963; &#956;&#959;&#965;</span>, may be considered as such an attempt. In the
place of the servants of men, who appeared to them unworthy of such honour, they
put the servants of God. <i>Abarbanel</i> asserts that the Spirit of God here means
something inferior to the gift of prophecy, which is bestowed only upon the free
people. Instead of regarding the Spirit of God as the root and fountain of the particular
gifts mentioned in the preceding verse, he sees in Him only an isolated gift,&mdash;that
of an indefinite knowledge of God. But such a view is opposed even by the relation
of the words, &quot;I will pour out My Spirit,&quot; in ver. 2, to the same words in ver.
1; and also by Is. xi. 2, where &quot;Spirit of God&quot; is likewise used in a general sense,
and comprehends within itself all that follows. It is not without design that the
fact is so prominently brought out in the New Testament, that the Gospel is preached
to the poor, and that God chooses that which is mean and despised in the eye of
the world. The natural man is always inclined to suppose that that which is esteemed
by the world must be so by God also. This is sufficiently evident from the deep
contempt of the Pharisees for the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8004;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>; compare,
<i>e.g.</i>, John vii. 49.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And I give wonders in the heavens, and on earth; blood,
and fire, and vapour of smoke.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The mercy bestowed upon the Congregation of God is accompanied
by the judgment upon her enemies. Since the Congregation has again become the object
of His favour, especially in consequence of the Holy Spirit being poured out upon
her, it cannot be but that He will protect her against the persecution of the world,
and avenge her upon it. In vers. 3 and 4, the <i>precursors</i> of the judgment
(<i>before</i> cometh, ver. 4) are described, and in chap. iv. throughout, the judgment
itself. There is here an allusion to an event of former times, and which is now
to be repeated on a larger scale, viz., the plagues inflicted upon Egypt in consequence
of the same law. The prophet had specially in view the passage, Deut. vi. 22: &quot;And
the Lord gave signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon
all his household before our eyes.&quot;&mdash;The wonders are divided
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span> into those which are in heaven, and those
which are on earth; then those which are on earth are in this verse designated individually;
and afterwards, in ver. 4, those which are in heaven. With regard to the former,
many interpreters (the last of whom is <i>Credner</i>) understand by the &quot;blood,&quot;
bloody defeats of the enemies of Israel; by &quot;fire and smoke,&quot; their towns and habitations
consumed by fire. But this interpretation cannot be entertained. The very designation
by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;</span> indicates that we have here to think
of extraordinary phenomena of nature, the symbolical language of which is interpreted
by the evil conscience, which recognises in them the precursors of coming judgment.
This is confirmed also by the more particular statement of the signs in heaven,
in ver. 4; for the signs on earth must certainly be of the same class as these.
It is confirmed likewise by a comparison with the type of former times, which we
have pointed out; for it is from this, that the blood is directly taken. The first
plague is thus announced in Exod. vii. 17: &quot;Behold, I smite with the rod in mine
hand upon the waters in the river, and they are turned into blood.&quot; <i>Jalkut Simeoni</i>
(in <i>Schöttgen</i>, p. 210) remarks: &quot;The Lord brought blood upon the enemies
in Egypt: thus also shall it be in future times; for it is written, I will give
wonders, blood and fire.&quot; The same is the case as respects the fire. Exod. ix. 24:
&quot;And there came hail, and <i>fire mingled</i> with the hail.&quot; It is more natural
to suppose that the prophet borrowed these features, as, in the former description
of the judgment upon Israel, the plague of the locusts lies at the foundation, and
as the contents of the following verse have likewise their prototype in those events.
Compare Exod. x. 21: &quot;And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
the heaven, and let there be darkness over the land of Egypt.&quot; That it is not real
blood which is here meant, but that only which, by its blood-red colour, reminds
of blood (comp. <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Waters red as blood,&quot; 2 Kings iii. 22), is shown by
the fundamental passage, Exod. vii. 17, where the water which had become red is
called simply blood; compare my work on <i>Egypt and the Books of Moses</i>, p.
106. Blood brings into view the shedding of blood; the fiery phenomena announce
that the fire of the anger of God, and the fire of war, will be enkindled; compare
remarks on i. 19, 20.&mdash;The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;</span> requires
a renewed investigation. Interpreters <span class="pagenum">[Pg 340]</span> uniformly
explain it by &quot;pillars,&quot;&mdash;a signification which is altogether destitute of any foundation;
for the Chaldee <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1500;&#1512;&#1492;</span>, to which they refer,
is not found with the signification &quot;pillar.&quot; Such a meaning is quite inappropriate
in the single passage quoted by <i>Buxtorf</i>; the signification &quot;smoke,&quot; or &quot;cloud
of smoke,&quot; is necessarily required in that place. As little are we at liberty to
appeal to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1502;&#1512;</span>, &quot;palm,&quot; with which
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;</span> has nothing at all to do. The
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;</span>, which would be without any analogy if derived
from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1502;&#1512;</span> (compare <i>Ewald</i> on <i>Song
of Sol.</i> iii. 6), requires the derivation from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;</span>. The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;</span> is a noun formed
from the 3d pers. <i>fem. Fut.</i> of this verb with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;</span> affixed (compare, on these nouns, the remarks
on Hos. ii. 14, and my work on <i>Balaam</i>, p. 434), and, as to its form, it corresponds
exactly with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span>, derived from the 3d <i>
fem. Fut.</i> of the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;</span>. There cannot
now be any doubt regarding the signification of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;</span>.
Is. lxi. 6, and Jer. ii. 11, where <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;</span> occur in the same verse, show that it
corresponds entirely with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;</span>. Hence <i>Ewald</i>
(l. c.) is wrong in identifying it with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</span>,
the alleged meaning of which is &quot;to be high.&quot; Now in Hebrew,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;</span>
occur only in the derived signification of &quot;to transform,&quot; &quot;to change,&quot; &quot;to exchange;&quot;
but the primary signification is furnished by the Arabic, where it means: <i>huc
illuc latus, agitatus fuit,&mdash;-fluctuavit.</i> (Compare the thorough demonstration
by <i>Scheid</i>, <i>ad cant. Hisk.</i> p. 159 sqq.)
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;</span> can accordingly signify only &quot;clouds&quot;
or &quot;<i>vortices</i>.&quot; (In Arabic, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;</span> means
&quot;dust agitated by the wind.&quot;) The connection of this signification with that of
&quot;<i>palpehrae</i>,&quot; &quot;eye-lids,&quot; in which it occurs in the Talmudic and Rabbinical
languages, is very obvious. They were so called from their continual motion hither
and thither. Such a connection, however, we must the more easily be able to prove,
because that Talmudic and Rabbinical use of the word cannot be derived from any
other root than an ancient Hebrew one. The <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#964;&#956;&#8055;&#962;</span>
of the LXX. likewise leads to our interpretation, rather than to the prevailing
one. The former is, in the only passage in which <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;</span> occurs, besides the one under consideration, and where it likewise
occurs in the connection with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1513;&#1503;</span>, viz., in
Song of Sol. iii. 6, at least as suitable as the latter. We have to think here of
such phenomena as those which are described in Exod. xix. 18: &quot;And Mount Sinai was
altogether on a smoke, because the Lord had descended upon <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 341]</span> it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace.&quot;
Here, as well as there, the fire, and the accompanying smoke, represent, in a visible
manner, the truth that God is <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#8166;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;</span>,
Heb. xii. 29. The clouds of smoke are the sad forerunners of the clouds of smoke
of the divine judgments upon the enemies, and of the fire of war, in the form of
which the former commonly appear. Compare Is. ix. 18, 19: &quot;And they mount up like
the lifting up of smoke.... And the people became as the fuel of fire; no man spareth
his brother.&quot; The belief&mdash;which pervades all antiquity&mdash;that the angry Deity announced
the breaking in of judgments through the symbolical language of nature, is very
remarkable. This belief cannot be a mere delusion, but must have a deep root in
the heart. Nature is the echo and the reflection of the disposition of man. If there
prevail within him a fearful expectation of things to come, because he feels his
own sin, and that of his people, all things external harmonize with that expectation;
and, most of all, that which is the natural image and symbol of divine punitive
justice, which would not, however, be acknowledged as such, were it not for the
interpreting voice within. Having regard to this relation of the mind to nature,
God, previous to great catastrophes, often causes those precursors of them to appear
more frequently and vividly, than in the ordinary course of nature. In a manner
especially remarkable, this took place previous to the destruction of Jerusalem.
Compare <i>Josephus</i>, <i>d. Bell. Jud.</i> iv. 4, 5. &quot;For during the night, a
fearful storm arose,&mdash;there arose boisterous winds with the most violent showers,
continual lightnings and awful thunders, and tremendous noises, while the earth
was shaken. It was, however, quite evident that the condition of the universe was
put into such disorder for the destruction of men, and almost every one conjectured
that these were the signs of impending calamity.&quot; A great number of other signs
and precursors are mentioned by him in <i>B. J.</i> vi. 5, § 3. These will never
be altogether absent, as certainly as punishment never comes without sin, and sin
never exists without the consciousness, without the expectation, of deserved judgment.
But the chief point in this mode of viewing things, is not the sign itself, but
the disposition of mind which interprets it,&mdash;the consciousness of guilt, which fills
the soul with the thought of an avenging God,&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>
<i>condition of filings which brings into view the infliction of the judgment.</i>
It is by this that we can account for the circumstance that; in the Old Testament,
the darkening of the sun and moon, and other things, frequently appear as <i>direct
images</i> of sad and heavy times.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>The sun is turned into darkness, and the moon into
blood, before there cometh the great and terrible day of the Lord.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Among all interpreters, <i>Calvin</i> has given the most admirable
interpretation of this verse: &quot;When the prophet says that the sun shall be turned
into darkness, and the moon into blood, these are metaphorical expressions, by which
he indicates that the Lord will show signs of His wrath to all the ends of the earth,
as if a whole revolution of nature were to take place, in order that men may be
stirred up by terror. For, as sun and moon are witnesses of God&#39;s fatherly kindness
towards us, as long as, in their changes, they provide the earth with light, so
will they, on the other hand, says the prophet, be the messengers of the angry and
offended God.&mdash;By the darkness of the sun, by the bloody appearance of the moon,
by the black cloud of smoke, the prophet intended to express the idea, that wheresoever
men should turn their eyes, upwards or downwards, many things would appear to fill
them with terror. Hence the language of the prophet amounts to this:&mdash;that never
had the state of things in the world been so miserable,&mdash;that never had there appeared
so many and so terrible signs of the anger of God.&quot;&mdash;We have already seen that the
prophet has before his eye the Egyptian type. The darkness upon the whole land of
Egypt, while there was light in the dwellings of the Israelites, represented, in
a deeply impressive manner, the anger of God in contrast with His grace, of which
the symbol is the shining of His heavenly lights. The extinction of these is, in
Scripture, frequently the forerunner of coming divine judgments, or an image of
those which have been already inflicted; compare the remarks on Zech. xiv. 6. Thus
it has already occurred in the Book of Joel itself, in the description of the former
judgment; compare ii. 2: &quot;Day of darkness and gloominess, day of clouds and mist;&quot;
ii. 10: &quot;Before Him quaketh the earth, and trembleth the heaven; the sun and the
moon mourn, and the stars withdraw their shining.&quot; Thus it returns in iv.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span> 14, 15: &quot;The day of the Lord is near in the
valley of judgment. The sun and the moon mourn, and the stars withdraw their shining.&quot;
The passages in which, as in the one before us, the extinction has not a <i>figurative</i>,
but a <i>typical</i> character, must not be limited to a single phenomenon. Everything
by which the brightness of the heavenly luminaries is clouded or darkened, eclipses
of the sun or moon, earthquakes, thunderstorms, etc., fill with fear those in whose
hearts the sun of grace has set.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>And it comes to pass, every one who calls on the name
of the Lord is saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be such as have escaped,
as the Lord hath said, and amongst those who are spared is whomsoever the Lord calleth.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">We must first determine the signification of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;</span>. The greater number of interpreters
explain it by &quot;deliverance;&quot; but it means rather &quot;that which has escaped.&quot; This
appears, 1. from the form. It is the fem. of the Adj.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;</span>, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1460;&#1470;&#1497;</span>
of which has arisen from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1461;&#1470;</span> by means of
lengthening; hence it is that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</span> is
thrice formed without <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1460;&#1470;&#1497;</span>. It is, then,
an adjective of intransitive signification. Now it is true that, by means of the
feminine termination, adjectives are changed into abstract nouns, but never into
such as indicate an action; but always into such only for which, in Latin and Greek,
the neuter of the adjective might be used. This, however, is here inadmissible.
2. To this must be added the constant use; as in Is. xxxvii. 31, 32: &quot;And <i>that
which has escaped</i> (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1514;</span>) of the house
of Judah, the <i>remnant</i>, taketh root downward, and beareth fruit upward. For
out of Jerusalem shall go forth a <i>remnant</i> (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span>),
and <i>that which has escaped</i> out of Mount Zion,&quot;&mdash;a passage exactly parallel
to the one under consideration (compare also the following words in Is. xxxvii.
32: &quot;For the zeal of the Lord will do this,&quot; with &quot;As the Lord hath said,&quot; here).
Is. iv. 2: &quot;To that which has escaped,&quot; with which, &quot;That which is left in Zion,
and that which remaineth in Jerusalem,&quot; in the following verse, is identical; Is.
x. 20: &quot;The remnant (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;</span>) of Israel, and that
which has escaped of the house of Jacob;&quot; Obad. ver. 17: &quot;And upon Mount Zion shall
be that which has escaped,&quot;&mdash;which forms an antithesis to ver. 9: &quot;And man shall
be cut off from the Mount of Esau;&quot; and <i>finally</i>&mdash;Gen. xxxii. 9 (8): &quot;And the
camp which has been left is for <span class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span> the escaped.&quot;
There does not thus remain a single passage in which the signification &quot;deliverance&quot;
is even the probable one. The passages in Jeremiah, where
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;</span> occur together (xlii. 17, xliv.
14; Lam. ii. 2), show that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;</span> here is not
different from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span> in the subsequent clause
of the verse.&mdash;The expression <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>
never is used of a merely outward invocation, but always of such as is the external
expression of the faith of the heart; compare the remarks on Zech. xiv. 9. Even
on account of this stated condition, it is not possible to think of the deliverance
of the promiscuous multitude of Israel, in contrast with that of the Gentiles; for
the condition is one which is purely internal, and it affords an important hint
for the right understanding of what follows. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1499;&#1497;</span> by which it is connected remains inexplicable, if Mount Zion and Jerusalem
be considered as a place of safety and deliverance for all who are there externally.
The same thing is evident from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;</span>. The
sense is not by any means that all the inhabitants of Zion and Jerusalem shall be
delivered; but that there shall be some who have escaped&mdash;viz., those who call on
the name of the Lord; while those who do not, shall be consumed by the divine judgment.
The second condition stated by the prophet&mdash;that of being called by the Lord&mdash;is in
like manner internal. The words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1465;&#1492; &#1511;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;</span>
have so evident a reference to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;
&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</span>, that we cannot at all suppose, as <i>Credner</i> does, that they
refer to other subjects. On the contrary, they who <i>call on</i> the Lord, are
also they whom <i>He calls</i> from the general calamity into His protecting presence;
and the prophet has endeavoured, by the choice of the words, to bring out into view
the close connection of these two parties. They who call on the Lord, and they whom
the Lord calls (<i>Maurer&#39;s</i> explanation: &quot;And among those who have escaped is
every one who calls on the Lord&quot; [compare Ps. xiv. 4], gives a very feeble tautology),
are the very same upon whom, according to vers, 1 and 2, the fulness of the Spirit
has been poured out.&mdash;The words, &quot;As the Lord has said,&quot; indicate, that the faithful
ones may safely take comfort from this promise; inasmuch as it is not the word of
men, but of God. We may see, from such parallel passages as Is. i. 20, xiv. 5, lviii.
14, how little reason we have for thinking that the prophet here refers to some
other prophecy. That the prophet, and not the Lord Himself, is speaking in this
verse, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span> is evident from the words: &quot;Who calls
on the name <i>of the Lord</i>.&quot; It was, therefore, very suitable to show, that
it was by Immediate, divine commission that the prophet had given utterance to the
consolatory promise, that the people of God would escape in these great and heavy
judgments which were to come upon the world. That it is very natural for believers
to fear that the punishments which threaten the world should fall upon them also
who are living <i>in</i> the world, is shown by Rev. vii., the aim of which is,
throughout, to allay the anxious fear which might arise in believers when considering
the judgments which threaten the world. The relation of the whole verse to what
precedes and follows is this:&mdash;In vers. 3 and 4, the prophet had stated the signs
and forerunners of the great and fearful day of the Lord. Now he points to the only,
and the absolutely sure means of standing on that day. Then, in chap. iv., which
is connected by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span>, he describes the judgment
itself.</p>
<p class="normal">If, now, we endeavour to discover the historical reference of
vers. 3-5, we are met by a great variety of opinions. It is referred to the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, by <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Cramer</i>, <i>Turrettine</i>
(<i>de Scrip, s. interpret.</i> p. 331); among the Socinians, in the <i>Raccovian
Catechism</i>, p. 22, and by <i>Oeder</i>; and among the Arminians, by <i>Episcopius</i>
in the <i>Instit. Theol.</i> p. 198. Others (as <i>Jerome</i>) think of the resurrection
of the Lord; others (as <i>Luther</i>) of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; others
(as <i>Münster</i>, <i>Capell</i>, <i>Lightfoot</i>, <i>Dresde</i>, l.c. p. 22)
of the destruction by the Romans. It is referred to the judgment upon the enemies
of the Covenant-people soon after the return from the Babylonish captivity, by
<i>Ephraem Syrus</i>; to the impending overthrow of Gog, at the time of the Messiah,
by the Jewish interpreters; to the general judgment, by <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Theodoret</i>,
and <i>Crusius</i>, In <i>Theol. Prophet.</i> i. p. 621; and to the destruction
of Jerusalem, and the general judgment at the same time, by <i>Chrysostom</i> and
others.</p>
<p class="normal">The great variety of these references has arisen solely from the
circumstance, that the prophecy has not been reduced to its fundamental idea. This
fundamental idea is:&mdash;The manifestation of God&#39;s punitive justice upon all which
is hostile to His kingdom, which runs parallel with the manifestation of His grace
towards the subjects of His kingdom. This idea appears here, in all its generality,
without any temporal limitation <span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span> whatsoever.
Not one of these interpretations, therefore, can be absolutely right. They differ
only in this, that some of them are altogether false, inasmuch as they assume a
reference to events which do not at all fall under the fundamental idea; while others
are only limited and partial views of the truth.</p>
<p class="normal">To the first of these classes belong evidently the references
to the resurrection, and to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. It is only by detaching
these verses from the following chapter that such a view could arise. These events
stand in no relation whatsoever to the animating thought of the passage. There is
a certain relation to that thought in the reference to the destruction by the Chaldeans,
in so far as this was really a manifestation of divine punitive justice. But the
reference to this event would be admissible here, only if the prophet were describing
the manifestation of divine punitive justice <i>in general</i>. But such is not
the case. The comparison of chap. i. and ii. shows that the subject of the prophecy
is rather the manifestation of divine justice in reference to those who are enemies
to the kingdom of God. The defenders of such a view have altogether misunderstood
the structure of the prophecy of Joel; for, otherwise, they would have seen that
that event belongs to the threatening of judgment in chap. i. and ii., where the
judgment upon the house of God is described; while, here, there is a description
of the judgment upon those who are without.</p>
<p class="normal">The same argument seems, at first sight, to apply also to the
destruction by the Romans. But on a closer examination, there appears to be a difference
betwixt these two events, and one which brings the latter far more within the scope
of the prophecy. The destruction by the Romans was much more intimately connected
with a total apostasy and rejection, than was that by the Chaldeans. Even before
the former destruction, and immediately after the death of Christ, the former Covenant-people
had sunk down to the rank of the Gentiles. They were no more apostate children,
who were, by means of punishment, to be brought to reformation, but enemies, who
were judged on account of their hostile disposition towards the kingdom of God.
Malachi, in chap. iii. 23 (iv. 5), shows that such a time would come when that,
which they imagined to be intended only for the heathen by descent, should be realized
upon Israel after the flesh. The verbal repetition of the words, &quot;Before there
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 347]</span> cometh the great and dreadful day of the Lord,&quot;
and their application to the judgment upon Israel, can be accounted for only by
his intention to oppose the prevailing carnal interpretation of the prophecy under
consideration.</p>
<p class="normal">It will now be seen also, what the relation is which the phenomena
at the death of Christ, the darkening of the sun, the quaking of the earth, the
rending of the rocks (compare Matt. xxvii. 45, 51; Luke xxiii. 44), occupy to the
passage before us. They were like the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;</span>
here, actual declarations of the divine wrath, and forerunners of the approaching
judgment; and they were recognised as such by the guilty, to whom this symbolical
language was interpreted by their consciences; compare Luke xxiii. 48:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#959;&#7985; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#8004;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#953;; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#8055;&#945;&#957;
&#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#957;, &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8048; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, &#964;&#8059;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#964;&#8053;&#952;&#951;, &#8017;&#960;&#8051;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#966;&#959;&#957;.</span></p>
<p class="normal">But we must not limit ourselves to the obduracy of the Covenant-people.
This we are taught, not only by the relation of chap. i. and ii. to iv. 2, but,
with especial distinctness, by the renewal of this threatening in Rev. xiv. 14-20,
where the image of the vintage and winepress, in particular, is borrowed from Joel;
see iv. 12, 13. The objects of judgment are there the heathen nations on account
of their hostility to the people of God, who, by Christ, and by the outpouring of
the Spirit procured by Him, have fully attained to that dignity. Nor is the judgment
there an isolated one. On the contrary, all which, in history, is realized in an
entire series of judicial acts, to be at last consummated in the final judgment,
is there comprehended in one great harvest&mdash;in one great vintage.</p>
<p class="normal">We have still to make a few remarks upon the quotation in Acts
ii. 16 ff. Nothing but narrow-mindedness and prejudice could deny that Peter found,
in the miracle of Pentecost, an actual fulfilment of the promise in vers. 1 and
2. This becomes probable, not only from the circumstance, that the reference of
this prophecy to the Messianic time was the prevailing one among the Jews (compare
the passages in <i>Schöttgen</i>, S. 413), but also from the translation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;</span> by <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957;
&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#967;&#8049;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span>, by which, in the New Testament, the Messianic time
is always designated. To this must also be added the express declaration in ver.
39, that the promise was unto the generation then present. How could Peter have
uttered such a declaration, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span> if his view had
been that the promise had found its fulfilment in a time long gone past? At the
same time, it is equally certain, that Peter was so far from considering all the
riches of the promise to be completely exhausted by that Pentecostal miracle, that
he rather considered it to be only a beginning of the fulfilment,&mdash;a beginning, indeed,
which implies the consummation, as the germ contains the tree. This is quite obvious
from ver. 38: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#8053;&#964;&#969; &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#963; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;....
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#969;&#961;&#949;&#8048;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7937;&#947;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;.</span> How could Peter, referring to
the prophecy, promise the gift of the Holy Spirit, promised in the prophecy to those
who should be converted, if the prophecy was already completely fulfilled? But it
is still more apparent from ver. 39: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8025;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#947;&#8049;&#961; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;
&#7969; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#8055;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#964;&#8051;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8048;&#957;, &#8004;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;.</span> The question is, who are to be understood by those
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8048;&#957;</span>? No one could have doubted that
the Gentiles are thereby to be understood, unless two things altogether heterogeneous
had been confounded, viz., the uncertainty of Peter concerning the <i>fact</i> of
the reception of the Gentiles into the kingdom of God, and his uncertainty concerning
the <i>mode</i> of their reception. Considering the condition of the Old Testament
prophecy, the latter is easily accounted for; but the former cannot. To state only
one from among the mass of arguments which prove that Peter could not be ignorant
of the <i>fact</i>, we observe that the very manner in which, in Acts iii. 25, he
quotes the promise given to Abraham, that by his seed the nations should be blessed,
proves that he regarded the Gentiles as partakers of the kingdom of Christ. This
is rendered still more incontrovertible by the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>
in ver. 26. To understand, by <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8048;&#957;</span>, foreign
Jews, is inadmissible, for the single reason that these were present in great numbers,
and hence, were included in the term <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span>.
Now Peter, throughout, addresses all those who were present. How then could he have
here confined himself, all at once, to a portion of these I There is, moreover,
a plain allusion to the close of Joel iii. 5, which the LXX. translate
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#8019;&#962; &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#8051;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>. This allusion contains,
at the same time, a proof of the concurrent reference to the Gentiles, which is
not in express words contained in the prophecy, provided we do not put an arbitrary
interpretation upon <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1512;</span>. Attention is thereby
directed <span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span> to the fact, that, In that passage,
salvation, which requires, as its condition, a participation in the outpouring of
the Spirit, does not depend upon any human cause, but solely upon the call of God&mdash;upon
His free grace. In a manner entirely similar, does St Paul, in Rom. x. 12, 13, prove,
from the beginning of Joel iii. 5, the participation of the Gentiles in the Messianic
kingdom: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#927;&#8016; &#947;&#8049;&#961; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8052; &#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7965;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#959;&#962;&#903;
&#8001; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8057;&#957;. &#928;&#8118;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961;
&#8003;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#965;, &#963;&#969;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;.</span> If the calling on God were
the condition of salvation, access to it was as free to the Gentiles as to the Jews.
But if the prophecy has a distinct reference to the still unconverted Jews, their
children and the Gentiles, it is then evident, that, according to the view of the
Apostle, it did not terminate in that one instance of Its fulfilment, but that,
on the contrary, it extends just as far as the thing promised&mdash;as the outpouring
itself of the Holy Spirit. This clearly appears, also, from the allusions to the
passage under consideration. In the accounts of later outpourings of the Spirit;
compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Acts x. 45, xi. 15, xv. 8. How, then, was it even possible
that Peter should have limited to the few who had already, at that time, received
the Spirit, a prophecy, in which the idea of generality is, intentionally, made
so prominent? But, even if the universal character of the prophecy had been less
distinct, Peter would certainly not have thought of confining it in such a manner.
Such a gross and superficial view of the prophecies was far from Peter, as well
as from the other Apostles.</p>
<p class="normal">Another question remains to be answered. For what purpose does
the Apostle quote verses 3-5 also, inasmuch as, apparently, verses 1 and 2 alone
properly served his purpose; and what sense did he put upon them? The answer Is
given In ver. 40: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7961;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#949; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#959;&#963;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#949;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8059;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#959;,
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#8049;&#955;&#949;&#953;, &#955;&#8051;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#903; &#931;&#8061;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#949; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8118;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#8118;&#962; &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#962;.</span> Even in the
few words In which Luke communicates to us the brief summary of what Peter spoke
In this respect, a reference to the passage under consideration has been preserved
to us. Peter made use of the threatening which was, in the first Instance, to be
fulfilled upon the dark refuse of the Covenant-people, In order to Induce them,
by terror, to seek a participation in the promise which alone could deliver them
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</span> from the threatened judgment. That he succeeded
in this, is shown by the words, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7960;&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#8049;&#963;&#8131; &#966;&#8057;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>,
in ver. 43. Several interpreters have, by ver. 22, been led into a total misconception
of the sense in which Peter quotes vers. 3-5. It is true, certainly, that the words
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8055;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> are not used without reference
to the passage in Joel. Peter directs attention to the circumstance, that they who,
from their hardness of heart, do not acknowledge the
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> and <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>
with which God accompanied the manifestation of His grace, shall be visited by
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> and <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>
of a totally different nature, from the fearful impression of which they shall not
be able to escape.</p>
<p class="normal">But let us now in addition consider some of the particulars. In
substance, the quotation by Peter agrees with the LXX.; but deviations occur on
particular points. At the very beginning, the LXX., adhering more closely to the
Hebrew text, have: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span>; whereas
Peter says: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#967;&#8049;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;.</span>
The reason of this deviation is, that the Apostle intends to determine, by this
deviation, the expression, which in itself is wider and more indefinite, in such
a manner that the period to which the prophecy specially refers, and hence also
its application to the case in question, should be rendered more obvious. In a case
entirely similar, Jeremiah, in chap. xlix. 6, employs the wider term
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;</span>, while in xlviii. 47 he makes use
of the more definite <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>. By the
latter term, <i>Kimchi</i> also explains the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;</span>
in the passage before us; while <i>Jarchi</i> (compare <i>Schöttgen</i>, S. 210)
explains it by the equivalent term <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;</span>.
The words <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#955;&#8051;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#8001; &#920;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</span> are wanting in the LXX.,
as well as in the original Hebrew text. They have been taken from ver. 5, and, contrasted
with <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#7992;&#969;&#8053;&#955;</span>, they
direct attention to the divine source of prophecy, and hence to the necessity of
its fulfilment. The two members, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#8059;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;

has reversed; probably in order to place the young men together with the sons and
daughters, and to assign the place of honour to the old men. In the
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;</span> and
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#945;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;</span>, Peter follows the LXX., and that
in a sense which only expressly makes prominent a point really contained in the
prophecy, whether such was intended by the translators, or not; for the circumstance
that the servants of men were, at the same <span class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span>time,
servants of God, formed the ground of their participation in the promise. The same
contrast is found, <i>e.g.</i>, in 1 Cor. vii. 22, 23:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8009; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#8179; &#954;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8059;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#957;&#903;
&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8055;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#8059;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;, &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#8057;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;. &#932;&#953;&#956;&#8134;&#962; &#7968;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#903; &#956;&#8052; &#947;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;
&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#953; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</span>; compare Gal. iii. 28; Philem. 10. Hence it is equivalent
to: Upon servants and handmaids of men who are, at the same time, my servants and
handmaids, and, therefore, in spiritual things of equal rank with those who are
free. To give prominence to this perfect equality, is also the design of the additional
clause: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8059;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;</span>, subjoined after
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#967;&#949;&#8182; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#8057;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;.</span> The circumstance
that Peter thought it necessary to add this clause, which, as we have proved, quite
harmonizes with the design of the prophet, seems to prove that, even at his time,
interpretations were current, in which an attempt was made to diminish, or altogether
to take away, in the case of servants and handmaids, their participation in those
blessings;&mdash;interpretations similar to those of <i>Abarbanel</i>, and even of <i>
Grotius</i>, who thus paraphrases the verse: &quot;Even to those who seem to be lowest,
I will certainly impart, although not prophesying and dreaming dreams, yet certain
extraordinary and heavenly motions.&quot; The antiquity of this false interpretation
is attested by <i>Jerome</i> also, who probably was, in this respect, altogether
dependent upon his Jewish teachers. He interprets, indeed, the servants and handmaids
spiritually, and of such as have not the spirit of freedom he says: &quot;They shall
neither have prophecies, nor dreams nor visions, but, satisfied with the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit, they shall possess only the grace of faith and salvation.&quot;&mdash;In
ver. 3, Peter adds <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#969;</span> to
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#8183;</span>, and
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#8049;&#964;&#969;</span> to <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#947;&#8134;&#962;</span>, in order to make the contrast more obvious and striking. All the deviations
from the LXX., and the original text, are thus of the same kind, and intended to
bring out more distinctly what is implied in the passage itself. Not one of them
need to be accounted for by the circumstance, that the Apostle quoted from memory.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_352" href="#div2Ref_352">THE PROPHET AMOS.</a></h2>
<h3><a name="div3_352" href="#div3Ref_352">GENERAL PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">It will not be necessary to extend our preliminary remarks on
the prophet Amos, since on the main point&mdash;viz., the circumstances under which he
appeared as a prophet&mdash;the introduction to the prophecies of Hosea may be regarded
as having been written for those of Amos also. For, according to the inscription,
they belong to the same period at which Hosea&#39;s prophetic ministry began, viz.,
the latter part of the reign of Jeroboam II., and after Uzziah had ascended the
throne in Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">The circumstances of the prophet we learn, generally, from the
words in chap. i. 1: &quot;Who was among the herdmen of Tekoah.&quot; If there existed no
other statement than this, there might be truth in the remark made by many interpreters,
that we cannot, from his having been a herdman, infer that he was poor and low.
It is shown, however, by a statement in chap. vii. 14, that, by the &quot;herdman,&quot; we
are not to understand one who was also possessed of flocks, or, like David, the
son of such, but a poor servant herdman. For, in that passage, the prophet replies
to the command of the priest Amaziah to get himself out of the country, to which
he did not belong, and to return to his native land: &quot;I am no prophet, nor the son
of a prophet, but I am a herdman; and <i>such an one as plucketh sycamores</i>.
And the Lord took me from behind the flock, and the Lord said unto me. Go prophesy
unto My people Israel.&quot; The fruit of the sycamores, called
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7940;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> and <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span>
by <i>Dioscorides</i>, served as food for only the poorest and meanest. <i>Bochart</i>
(<i>Hieroz.</i> t. i. p. 407 [385] <i>Rosenmüller</i>) remarks: &quot;It is the same
as if he had said, that he was a man of the humblest condition, and born in poor
circumstances, so that he scarcely maintained his life by scanty and frugal fare;
that he had never thought of obtaining the prophetical office in Israel, until a
higher power, viz., divine inspiration, impelled him to undertake it.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_352a" href="#ftn_352a">[1]</a></sup>
But this passage merits our attention in another <span class="pagenum">[Pg 353]</span>
point of view. In what sense is it that Amos here denies that he is a prophet? It
is evidently in a very special sense that he does so. He obviously does not mean
thereby to deny that he possessed the gift of prophecy, or held the prophetical
office; for, otherwise, he would himself have furnished weapons to his enemy, to
whom he wishes to prove his right. The following remarks will be found to contain
the true answer.</p>
<p class="normal">It cannot be proved in any way, that the schools of the prophets,
established by Samuel at a time when the circumstances of Judah and Israel were
altogether similar, were continued in the kingdom of Judah. Every prophet there
stands in an isolated position. The entire prophetic order and institute bears rather
a sporadic character. But in the kingdom of Israel, where the prophetic order occupied
a position altogether different from that which it held in the kingdom of Judah,
inasmuch as, after the expulsion of the tribe of Levi, they had to watch over all
the interests of religion, the schools of the prophets had a very important mission
assigned to them. We must not by any means imagine that their constitution was such,
that after a few years&#39; training, the sons of the prophets attained to perfect independence.
The greater number of them remained during all their lifetime in the position of
sons. The schools of the prophets were a kind of monasteries. Even those who, in
consequence of their peculiar circumstances, no longer remained there, but were
scattered throughout the country, continued always under their authority. One needs
only to read attentively the histories of Elijah and of Elisha, which afford us
the fullest information regarding these institutions, to be speedily convinced of
the soundness of the view which we have here presented. On the subject of the organization
of the schools of the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, compare <i>Dissertations
on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>, i. p. 185. f.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</span></p>
<p class="normal">But how can Amos adduce it as a proof of his divine mission, that
he is neither a prophet, nor, in the sense explained, a prophet&#39;s son, <i>i.e.</i>,
that he was neither a superior nor an inferior member of the prophetic order? The
answer is,&mdash;It was the result of that organization of the prophetic order, that the
relation to the Lord was one which was more or less mediate. To those who would
not acknowledge the immediate divine influence, some ground was thereby afforded
for doing so. Their training, their principles, the form of their prophecies, all
admitted of a natural explanation. It is true that the <i>spirit</i> which animated
them baffled any such attempt; but that spirit was not so easily perceived. In the
case of any one, then, who appeared as a prophet, without standing in that connection,
and yet in the full possession of all prophetic gifts,&mdash;in demonstration of the spirit
and of power, a natural explanation was far more difficult; especially if, like
Amos, he was, by his outward situation, cut off from all human resources for education.
But was Amos, for that reason, an uneducated man? This is a question which one may
answer either in the affirmative or negative, according to what he understands by
education. So much is certain, that he was in possession of the essential part of
a true Israelitish education&mdash;viz., the knowledge of the law. The most intimate acquaintance
with the Pentateuch everywhere manifests itself; compare in proof of this the <i>
Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>, i. p. 136 ff. There are
too many instances, down to most recent times, of living piety breaking, in this
respect, through almost impenetrable barriers, to allow us to consider this as a
strange thing, and to make it necessary for us to excogitate the various ways and
means by which Amos may have received this education. It is only on the lower ground
of the mere forms of language, that the rank of Amos not unfrequently appears. In
all the higher relations he shows himself a type of the Apostles, who, although
they were uneducated fishermen of Galilee, exhibit the most distinguishing proofs
of true education.</p>
<p class="normal">Amos belonged to that circle of prophets who received a commission
to prophesy the ruin which was impending over the Covenant-people, before any human
probability existed for it. <i>Baur</i>, on Amos, S. 60, is of opinion that &quot;the
definiteness with which he prophesies the destruction of the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 355]</span> Jeroboam, although its power was at that time
still flourishing, leads us to expect that he must have had distinct indications
of its speedy decay.&quot; In a certain sense we may assent to this opinion. The prophet
himself continually points to such indications. These indications are the sins of
the people. But if <i>Baur</i> endeavours to put political indications in the stead
of these moral ones; if he be of opinion that the Assyrians must, at that time,
have stood in a threatening attitude in the background, we must give to his opinion
a decided opposition. We can, in such an assertion, see only an effect of that naturalistic
mode of viewing things, which would limit the horizon of the prophets to that of
their own times.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_355a" href="#ftn_355a">[2]</a></sup>
Not the slightest allusion to the Assyrians occurs. The supposition that Calneh
or Ktesiphon, in chap. vi. 2, appears as having already fallen (through the Assyrians),
rests upon an incorrect interpretation, just as does the assertion that Hamath,
in the same passage, is supposed to be conquered; concerning the latter point, compare
<i>Thenius</i> on 2 Kings xiv. 28. In the announcement of the carrying away into
captivity beyond Damascus, made in chap. v. 27, there appears nothing more than
the knowledge, that the catastrophe will not be brought about by that heathen power
which had hitherto brought ruin upon the kingdom of Israel But, everywhere, we may
see that the prophet&mdash;whom we have no reason to think an especially ingenious politician&mdash;appeared
at a time when no one expected any danger. Amos prophesied at a time when the morning-dawn
had risen upon Israel, iv. 13, v. 8; &quot;in the beginning of the shooting up of the
grass, and behold the grass was standing, after the King (Jehovah) had caused to
be mown,&quot; vii. 1; at a time when the prosperity of the kingdom of the ten tribes
was again budding forth. In chap. viii. 9, the Lord threatens that He will cause
the sun to go down at noon, and bring darkness over the land in the day of <i>light</i>.
In chap. vi. 4-6, the prevailing careless luxury and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 356]</span>
joy are graphically described. Chap. v. 18 implies that the people mocked at the
threatening of the coming of the day of the Lord, the coming of which could, therefore,
not have been indicated by any human probability. In chap. vi. 1, the prophet gives
utterance to an exclamation of woe over them that are secure in Zion, and that trust
in the mountain of Samaria. In chap. vi. 13, he opposes the delusion of those &quot;who
rejoice in a thing of nought, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own
strength?&quot; The people in the kingdom of the ten tribes must accordingly have imagined
that they were living in the golden age of the fulfilment of Deut. xxx. 17, and
must not have thought for a moment that the axe was already laid to the root of
the tree.</p>
<p class="normal">But we are not at liberty to seek the fulfilment of the prophecy
of Amos, only in the visitation by the Assyrians. That which happens to the people
of the ten tribes is, to the prophet, only a part of a general visitation, which
comes, not only upon all the neighbouring nations, but upon Judah also, and which
brings utter ruin upon the latter, chap. ii. 4, 5, destroying the temple at Jerusalem,
and driving the house of David from the throne, ix. 1, 11. According to prophecy
and history, however, this catastrophe came upon Judah, not by Asshur, but, in the
first instance, by Babylon.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophecy possesses a comprehensive character, such as we should
be led to expect from the close connection of Amos with Joel. It comprehends everything
which Judah and Israel, along with the neighbouring people, had to suffer from the
rising heathen powers; compare vi. 14, v. 24, according to which, judgment shall
roll down as waters, and righteousness as a <i>continual</i> stream.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_356a" href="#ftn_356a">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">In the case of Amos, also, interpreters have been at considerable
pains in fixing the time and the occasion of the single portions, but with as little
success as in the cases of Hosea and Micah. The very inscription proves that we
have before us a whole, composed at one time, and containing the substance of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span> what the prophet had uttered previously, and
in a detached form. According to this inscription, the book was composed only two
years after the prophet&#39;s personal ministry in the kingdom of Israel. But if there
were such an interval betwixt the oral preaching of the prophet and its having been
committed to writing, it is, <i>a priori</i>, not likely that the latter should
have followed the former, step by step.</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;Two years before the earthquake,&quot; cannot be regarded
as a chronological date, intended to fix more definitely the exact time within the
more extended period previously stated, viz., &quot;the days of Uzziah and Jeroboam.&quot;
For such a purpose they are ill suited, inasmuch as the time of the earthquake is
not fixed; and, moreover, any such more definite determination would have been without
either significance or interest. This only was of importance, that the word of the
Lord should have been uttered in the days of Jeroboam, and that the prophecy of
the destruction should have been delivered at a time when the Israelites enjoyed
an amount of prosperity, such as they had not known for a long time. It can scarcely
be doubted that the earthquake under Uzziah, the fearfulness of which is testified
by Zech. xiv. 5, comes under consideration only as the reason for the composition
of the book,&mdash;for committing to writing what had formerly been delivered orally.
The earthquake denotes, in the symbolical language of Scripture, great revolutions,
by which the form of the earth is changed, and that which is uppermost, overturned;
compare my remarks on Rev. vi. 12. To point to such an earthquake had been the fundamental
thought of Amos&#39; oral predictions. By the natural earthquake, he was induced to
commit them to writing, that they might go side by side with the symbol, and serve
as its interpreter.</p>
<p class="normal">There is a plan in the arrangement of the book, which indicates
that the book is not a collection of separate discourses, but that it bears an independent
character. It is distinctly divided into two parts,&mdash;the first, made up of naked
prophecies, from chap. i. to chap. vi.; the second, of such prophecies as are connected
with a symbol, which is always very simple, and very briefly described,&mdash;from chap.
vii. to chap. ix.</p>
<p class="normal">In the first part, the prophet begins with the announcement of
the wrath of the Lord, ver. 2. He then reviews, in their <span class="pagenum">[Pg
358]</span> order, those kingdoms upon which it shall be poured out, viz., Damascus,
Philistia, Tyrus, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and Judah: until at last the storm reaches
to Israel, and, according to <i>Rückert&#39;s</i> striking remarks, remains suspended
over it.</p>
<p class="normal">In addition to Israel, there are seven nations, and the seven
are divided into three, and four; three not related to the people of the ten tribes,
and four related to them; the brotherly people of Judah being introduced after three
nations have been mentioned which are more distantly related to Israel.</p>
<p class="normal">According to <i>Rückert</i>, it is only in chap. ii. 6-16 that
the storm which remained suspended over Israel is described; then in chap. iii.-vi.
there follow four threatening discourses, which are not connected either with the
preceding ones, or with each other. But the correct view rather is, that this stationary
suspension is described in the whole of the first half,&mdash;in the main, indeed, even
to the end of the book.</p>
<p class="normal">This is evident from the consideration that, if such were not
the case, the treatment of the main subject would be, as regards the extent of the
description, greatly disproportioned to the introduction; for chap. i. to ii. 5
must be considered to be, throughout, merely introductory. But as the ground on
which we advance this assertion is made in opposition to an unsound view, it requires
a more particular determination. It is assumed by many interpreters, that in the
nations besides Israel, the prophet reproves &quot;some haughty excesses, but, evidently,
only as instances of the immorality prevailing&quot; (<i>Jahn</i>, <i>Einl.</i> 2, p.
404). But this view, according to which the prophet might, instead of the various
crimes mentioned, have noticed any other crime, <i>e.g.</i>, fornication, idolatry,
etc., is certainly erroneous. It is rather a <i>theocratic</i> judgment of which
he speaks throughout; they are crimes against the theocracy, the punishment of which
he announces. These he considers as being more heinous than all others; for the
guilt of the latter is diminished by the circumstance of their having been committed
against the hidden God only, while the former have been committed against the God
who has manifested Himself, and who is living among His people. For so much is evident,
that the main cause of the hatred of all the neighbouring nations against Israel
was, that Israel was the people of God. For where can an instance be found of a
hatred betwixt any <span class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span> two of them, so inextinguishable,
and continuing through centuries? How entirely different is, <i>e.g.</i>, the position
of Edom against Moab, from that of Edom against Israel? Three reasons confirm the
correctness of our assertion as to the purely theocratic nature of the judgment.
1. The general announcement of the judgment. &quot;Jehovah roareth from Zion, and from
Jerusalem He giveth His voice.&quot; The very use of the name Jehovah here deserves attention.
A judgment of a general kind upon the heathen would belong to God as Elohim. It
is Elohim who is the God of the heathen,&mdash;the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of
the world, from whom blessings, as well as judgments upon it, proceed. Now it might
be said that Jehovah is used in the case of the heathen also, for the sake of uniformity,
because to Him belongeth the judgment upon Judah and Israel. But that this is not
the case, is seen from the addition: &quot;From Zion,&mdash;from Jerusalem.&quot; Every general
judgment proceeds from heaven; it is only as a theocratic God, that God reigns in
Zion and Jerusalem. This argument admits of no exception; all that God does from
Zion is theocratic deliverance, or theocratic judgment.&mdash;2. The nature of the crimes
themselves, which are cited by way of example. It can certainly not be merely accidental,
that they are all such as were committed against the Covenant-people. There is one
only which forms an apparent exception, viz., that of the Moabites, who are, in
chap. ii. 1, charged with having burned into lime the bones of the king of Edom.
But, with the consent of the greater number of interpreters, <i>Jerome</i> remarks
on this: &quot;In order that God might show that He is the Lord of all, and that every
soul is subject to Him who formed it. He punishes the iniquity committed against
the king of Edom.&quot; But in this remark of Jerome, the relation in which Idumea stood
to the Covenant-people is altogether lost sight of. It is only as a vassal of their
kings that the king of Edom here comes into view. This is sufficiently manifest
from 2 Kings iii., although the event narrated there is different from that which
is here alluded to, of which no record has been preserved in history.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_359a" href="#ftn_359a">[4]</a></sup>
The hatred against the Covenant-people, which the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span>
Moabites were too weak openly to exhibit, impelled them to this wicked deed against
the king tributary to them.&mdash;3. It must be carefully observed how the prophet, when
coming to Judah, introduces us, at once, into the centre of <i>theocratic</i> transgression,
the forsaking of the living God, and the serving of vain, dead idols.</p>
<p class="normal">It will now be easily seen in what way the portion, chap. i.-ii.
5, serves as an introduction to what follows. The prophecies against foreign nations
do not, as elsewhere, serve as a consolation, or as a proof of the love of God towards
His people, and of His omnipotence, or as a means for destroying confidence in man&#39;s
power, in man&#39;s help; they are, on the contrary, intended, from the very outset,
to give rise in Israel to the question: If such be done in the green tree, what
shall be done in the dry? That question the prophet answers at large. If severe
punishment be inflicted, even upon those who have trespassed against the living
God, with whom they came into contact only distantly, what will become of those
to whom He manifested Himself so plainly and distinctly,&mdash;among whom He had, as it
were, gained a form,&mdash;before whose eyes He had been so evidently set forth? The declaration,
&quot;You only do I know of all the families of the earth; therefore I shall visit upon
you all your iniquities&quot; (iii. 2), forms the centre of the whole threatening announcement
to Israel. And could it indeed be introduced in any better way than by pointing
out, how even the lowest degree of knowledge was followed by such a visitation?
But now, that which under the Old Testament was the highest degree, becomes, under
the New Testament, only a preparatory step. The revelation of God in Christ stands
in the same relation to that made to Israel under the Old Testament, as the latter
stands to the manifestation of His character and nature to the heathen, who came
into connection with the Covenant-people. Thus the fulfilment becomes to us a new
prophecy. If the rejection of God, in His inferior revelation, was followed by such
awful consequences to the temporal welfare of the people of the Old Covenant, what
must be the consequences of the rejection of the highest and fullest revelation
of God to the temporal and spiritual welfare of the people of the New Covenant?
This is a thought which is further expanded in Heb. xii. 17 ff., and it forms the
essential feature of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span> the description of the
judgment of the world in the New Testament. This judgment has been but too often
thus misunderstood, as if it concerned the world as the world,&mdash;a misunderstanding
similar to that of the section before us. The Gospel shall first be preached to
every creature, and according as every one has conducted himself towards the <i>
living</i> God, so he shall be judged.&mdash;But it is not to the heathen nations only,
but to Judah also that, by way of introduction, destruction is announced. The circumstance
that not even the possession of so many precious privileges, as the temple and the
Davidic throne, could ward off the well-merited punishment of sin, could not but
powerfully affect the hearts of the ten tribes. If God&#39;s justice be so energetic,
what have <i>they</i> to expect?</p>
<p class="normal">If we continue the examination of <i>Rückert&#39;s</i> view, it will
soon appear that the phrase, &quot;Hear this word,&quot; in iii. 1, iv. 1, and v. 1, can alone
be considered as the foundation on which it rests. But these words do not at all
prove a new commencement, but only a new starting-point. This appears sufficiently
from the absence of these words at the alleged fourth threatening discourse in chap.
vi.; and likewise from a comparison of Hosea iv. 1 and v. 1: &quot;Hear the word of the
Lord, ye children of Israel,&quot; and &quot;Hear this, ye priests, and hearken, ye house
of Israel, and give ear, house of the king;&quot; while nothing similar occurs in the
following chapters. That such an exhortation was appropriate, even in the middle,
is clearly seen from Amos iii. 13. It cannot then, <i>per se</i>, prove anything
in favour of a new beginning. If it is to be regarded as such, the discourse must
be proved, by other reasons, to have been completed. But no such reasons here exist.
We might as reasonably assume the existence of ten threatening discourses, as of
four. The circumstance that we can nowhere discover a sure commencement and a clearly
defined termination, shows that we are fully justified in considering the whole
first part, chap. i. to vi., as a connected discourse.</p>
<p class="normal">The second part, which contains the visions of the destruction,
is composed, indeed, of various portions,&mdash;as might have been expected from the nature
of the subject. Each new vision, with the discourse connected with it, must form
a new section. Chap. vii., viii., and ix., form each a whole. From the account which
is added to the first vision; and which relates <span class="pagenum">[Pg 362]</span>
to the transactions between Amos and the high priest Amaziah, which were caused
by the public announcement of this vision (chap. vii. 12-14), we are led to suppose
that these visions were formerly delivered singly, in the form in which we now possess
them. But that, even here, we have not before us pieces loosely connected with each
other in a chronological arrangement, is evident from the fact, that the promises
stand just at the end of the whole collection. The prophet had rather to reprove
and to threaten than to comfort; but yet he cannot refrain, at least at the close,
from causing the sun to break through the clouds. Without this close there would
be wanting in Amos a main element of the prophetic discourse, which is wanting in
no other prophet, and by which alone the other elements are placed in a proper light.</p>
<p class="normal">It also militates against the supposition of a mere collection,
that in the last vision the prevailing regard to the kingdom of the ten tribes disappears
almost entirely, and that, like the third chapter of Hosea, it relates to the whole
of the Covenant-people,&mdash;in agreement with the reference to the earthquake mentioned
in the inscription, which the prophet had experienced in Judah, and which brought
into view, not a particular, but a general, judgment.</p>
<p class="normal">The symbolical clothing, however, forms the sole difference betwixt
the second part and the first. As the &quot;real centre and essence of the book&quot; the
second part cannot be regarded; the threatening is as clear and impressive in the
first part.</p>
<p class="normal">That which is common to Amos with the contemporary prophets, is
the absolute clearness with which he foresees that, before salvation comes, all
that is glorious, not only in Israel, but in Judah also, must be given over to destruction.
Judah and Israel shall be overflowed by the heathen world, the Temple at Jerusalem
destroyed, the Davidic dynasty dethroned, and the inhabitants of both kingdoms carried
away into captivity. But afterwards, the restoration of David&#39;s tabernacle (ix.
11), and the extension of the kingdom of God far beyond the borders of the heathen
world (ver. 12), take place. The most characteristic point is the emanation of salvation
from the family of David, at the time of its deepest abasement.</p>

<h3><a name="div3_399" href="#div3Ref_399">CHAPTER IX.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The chapter opens with a vision. The temple, shaken by the Angel
of the Lord in its very foundations, falls down, and buries Judah and Israel under
its ruins. Without a figure,&mdash;the breach of the Covenant by the Covenant-people brings
destruction upon them. The prophet endeavours to strengthen the impression of this
threatening upon their mind, by breaking down the supports of false security by
which they sought to evade it. There is no deliverance, no escape, vers. 2-4, for
the Almighty God is the enemy and pursuer, vers. 5, 6. There is no mercy on account
of the Covenant, for Israel is no more the Covenant-people. They shall not, however,
be altogether destroyed; but the destruction of the sinful mass shall be accompanied
by the preservation of a small number of the godly, vers. 7-10. This great sifting
is followed, however, by the restoration; the tabernacle of David which is fallen,
the kingdom of God among Israel, connected with the family of David, shall be raised
up again, ver. 11; rendered glorious by its extension over the heathen, ver. 12;
and blessed with the abundance of the divine gifts, vers. 12-15.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>I saw the Lord standing over the altar; and He said,
Smite the chapiter, and make the thresholds tremble, and break them upon the heads
of all; and I will kill their remnant by the sword: he that fleeth away of them
shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The principal question which here arises is:&mdash;Who is here addressed,&mdash;to
whom is the commission of destruction given by the Lord? As, in accordance with
the dramatic character of the prophetical discourse, the person is not more definitely
marked out, we can think of Him only who, throughout, executes God&#39;s judgments upon
the enemies of His kingdom. But He is the same to whom the preservation and protection
of the true members of His kingdom are committed, viz., the Angel of the Lord. It
was He, who, as <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;</span>, the destroying Angel,
smote the first-born of Egypt, Exod. xii. 2, 3, compared with 12, 13. It was from
Him that the destruction of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 364]</span> Assyrians
proceeded, 2 Kings xix. 34, 35; Is. xxxvii. 35, 36. After the numbering of Israel,
when the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, it was He who inflicted the
punishment, 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, 15, 16. As He encampeth round about them who fear the
Lord, so He is, in regard to the ungodly, like the wind which carries away the chaff,
Ps. xxxiv. 8, xxxv. 5, 6.&mdash;In opposition to the objection raised by <i>Baur</i>,&mdash;That,
with the exception of the passage in Is. vi., nowhere, in the books composed before
the Chaldee period, do angels appear to act as mediators in the execution of the
divine commands,&quot;&mdash;it is sufficient to refer to Joel iv. (iii.) 9-11, and, as regards
<i>the</i> Angel of the Lord, to Hosea xii. 5 (4). But we have, in addition, a special
reason for thinking here of the Angel of the Lord. This is afforded to us by the
ninth chapter of Ezekiel, which must be considered, throughout, as a further expansion
of the verse under consideration, and as the oldest and most trustworthy commentary
upon it. In that chapter, there appear (at the command of the Lord who is about
to avenge the apostasy of His people) the servants of His justice&mdash;six in number&mdash;and
in the midst of them, &quot;a man clothed with linen;&quot;&mdash;the former, with instruments of
destruction; the latter, with writing materials. They step (the scene is in the
temple) by the side of the brazen altar. Thither there comes to them out of the
holy of holies, to the threshold of the temple, the glory of the Lord, and gives
to Him who is clothed with linen the commission to preserve the faithful, while
the others receive a commission to destroy the ungodly, without mercy. But now,
Who is the man clothed in linen? None other than the Angel of the Lord. This appears
from Daniel x. 5, xii. 6, 7, where Michael = the Angel of the Lord (compare <i>Dissertations
on the Genuineness of Daniel</i>, p. 135 ff.) is designated in the same way,&mdash;a remarkable
coincidence in these two contemporary prophets, to which we omitted to direct attention
in our work on Daniel. It is <i>further</i> evident from the subject itself. The
dress is that of the earthly high priest (<i>Theodoret</i> remarks: &quot;The dress of
the seventh is that of the high priest, for he was not one of the destroyers, but
the redeemer of those who were worthy of salvation&quot;); compare Lev. xvi. 4, 23. It
is especially from the former of these passages that the plural
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span> is to be accounted for. According to
it, the various parts <span class="pagenum">[Pg 365]</span> of the high priest&#39;s
dress are of linen. But the heavenly Mediator, High Priest, and Intercessor, is
the Angel of the Lord; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Zech. i. 12, where He makes intercession
for the Covenant-people, and the Lord answers Him with good and comfortable words.
Concerning the earthly high priest as a type of Christ, and hence a type of the
Angel of the Lord, compare the remarks on Zech. iii. But we must not imagine that
He who is clothed with linen is commissioned solely for the work of delivering the
godly, and hence stands contrasted with the six ministers of justice. On the contrary,
these are rather to be considered as being subordinate to Him, as carrying out the
work of destruction only by His command and authority. From Him, punishment no less
than salvation proceeds. This is sufficiently evident for general reasons. The punishment
and deliverance have both the same root, the same aim, viz., the advancement of
the kingdom of God. We cannot by any means think of evil angels in the case of the
six; such could be assumed only in opposition to the whole doctrine of Scripture
on the point, which is always consistent in ascribing the punishment of the wicked
to the good angels, and the temptation of the godly, with the permission of God,
to the evil angels. In proof of this, we have only to think of Job&#39;s trial, of Christ&#39;s
temptation, and of the angel of Satan by whom Paul was buffeted. This subject has
already been very well treated by <i>Ode</i>, who, in his work <i>De Angelis</i>,
p. 741 ff., says: &quot;God sends good angels to punish wicked men, and He employs evil
angels to chasten the godly.&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_365a" href="#ftn_365a">[1]</a></sup>
But if this be established, it is then established at the same time, that the judgment
here belongs to the Angel of the Lord. For to Him, as the Prince of the heavenly
host, all inferior angels are subordinate, so that everything
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</span> which they do belongs to Him.&mdash;To these general
reasons, we may, however, add special reasons which are altogether decisive. That
He who is clothed with linen is closely connected with the six, is indicated by
the number seven. He also appears at the side of the altar, and comes in the midst
of the others, who follow after Him, ver. 2. But of conclusive significance are
the words in chap. x. 2 and 7: &quot;And the Lord spake unto the man clothed with linen,
and said, Go in between the wheels under the cherubim, and fill Thine hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And He
went in, in my sight. And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim,
unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took, and put it into the hands
of Him who was clothed with linen. And He took it and went out.&quot; The <i>fire</i>
here is not the symbolical designation of wrath, but natural fire; for it is the
setting on fire and burning of the city which is here to be prefigured. The wheels
denote the natural powers,&mdash;in the first instance, the wind, chap. x. 13, but the
fire also; while the cherubim denote the living creation. The Angel of the Lord
is here expressly designated as He who executeth the judgments of divine justice.</p>
<p class="normal">The importance of the preceding investigation extends beyond the
mere clearing up of the passage under consideration. We have here obtained the Old
Testament foundation for the New Testament doctrine, that all judgment has been
committed to the Son, while the harmony of the two Testaments is exhibited in a
remarkable instance. Compare with the already cited Old Testament declarations,
such passages as Matt. xiii. 41: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7944;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962;

<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#7956;&#955;&#952;&#8131; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#8131; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#959;&#8166;,

order to be convinced of the identity of the Angel of the Lord and Christ (compare
above, p. 107 sqq. and <i>Commentary on Rev.</i> i. p. 466), we may further direct
attention to the fact that the Angel of the Lord, who meets us throughout the whole
of the Old Testament, suddenly disappears in the New Testament, and that to Christ
all is ascribed which was in the Old Testament attributed to the Angel of the Lord.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</span></p>
<p class="normal">A second important question is:&mdash;What is to be understood by <i>
the</i> altar, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;</span>? Several interpreters
adopt the opinion of <i>Cyril</i>, and think of the altar at Bethel, or some other
idolatrous altar in the kingdom of Israel. Others (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Marckius</i>)
are of opinion that the article stands here without meaning, and that it is the
intention of the prophet only to represent God as appearing on some altar, leaving
it undetermined on which, in order thereby to indicate that He required the blood
of many men. But against such expositions the article is conclusive. <i>The</i>
altar can be that altar only, of which every one would think, if an altar
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>, and without a more definite designation,
were spoken of. Such was the brazen altar, or altar of burnt-offering in the outer
court of the temple at Jerusalem. That it was this altar, and not the altar of incense
before the holy of holies, which received, in the common language of the people,
the name of <i>the</i> altar, is easily explained from the circumstance that it
stood in a much closer relation to the people than did the other which was withdrawn
from their view. On this altar all the sacrifices were offered, and it must, throughout,
be understood, when <i>the</i> altar of the Lord is spoken of; compare remarks on
Rev. vi. 9. But that which removes all doubt is the comparison with the parallel
passage in Ezekiel. There, the scene is the temple at Jerusalem. The ministers of
justice step beside the brazen altar. At the threshold of the temple-building proper,
the glory of the Lord moves toward them. This parallel passage, moreover, does not
leave any doubt as to the reason why the Lord appears here beside the altar. <i>
Jerome</i> remarks on this: &quot;They are introduced standing beside the altar, ready
for the order of their commander; so that they know every one whose sins are not
forgiven, and who is liable, therefore, to the sentence of the Lord, and to destruction.&quot;
The Lord&#39;s appearing beside the altar is a visible representation of the truth,
that wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. The
altar is the place of transgression; it is there that there lies accumulated the
unexpiated guilt of the whole nation, instead of the rich treasure of love and faith,
which alone should be there, embodied in the sacrifice. The Lord appears at the
place of transgression, in order that He may be glorified in the destruction of
those who would not glorify Him in their lives.<span class="pagenum"> [Pg 368]</span>&mdash;Now
several interpreters (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Michaelis</i>), who have correctly defined
the meaning of the altar, would infer from the mention of the temple at Jerusalem,
that the whole prophecy refers to the kingdom of Judah. But such an assumption is
altogether inadmissible. Even the general reason, that a prophecy which refers exclusively
to Judah cannot be at all expected from a prophet who had received his special mission
to Israel, militates against it. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;The close of this prophecy, the
proclamation of salvation, belongs, as we have already proved, to the whole collection.
If this be referred to Judah alone, there is then an essential element awanting
in that portion which is addressed to Israel; we should then have judgment without
mercy, threatening without consolation,&mdash;a thing which could not well be conceived
of, and would be without analogy in any of the prophets. To this we must <i>further</i>
add the express references, or co-references to Israel throughout the whole chapter,&mdash;such
as the mention of Carmel in ver. 3; of the children of Israel, in ver. 7; of the
house of Jacob, in ver. 8; of the house of Israel, in ver. 9; of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;</span>, in ver. 11; of My people Israel, in
ver. 14. The whole assumption of an exclusive reference to Judah owes its origin
to the circumstance, that features which are only symbolical have been erroneously
interpreted as actual. But if they be viewed and explained as symbols, every reason
for denying the reference to Israel is then at once removed. The temple symbolizes
the kingdom of God; its falling down upon the people is symbolical of the punishment
which is inflicted upon them, in consequence of this kingdom. The destruction of
the temple in the literal sense is not, primarily, spoken of; although the latter,
it is true, be inseparable from the former. If the Covenant-people in general were
outwardly desecrated, because they had desecrated themselves inwardly, then also
the outward sanctuary which they had, by their wickedness, converted into a den
of thieves, was taken from them; compare the remarks on Dan. ix. 27. If Israel then,
at that time, still belonged to the kingdom of God (and this can certainly not be
doubted, and is sufficiently proved by the very mission of our prophet to Israel),
there exists no reason at all for excluding it. For Israel also, the temple at Jerusalem
formed the seat and centre from which it was governed,&mdash;the place from which blessings
and punishments <span class="pagenum">[Pg 369]</span> proceeded. The prophet indeed,
at the very opening of his prophecies, describes the Lord as roaring from Zion,
and uttering His voice from Jerusalem. On the altar at Jerusalem the crimes of Israel
were deposited, no less than those of Judah; for there was the place where the people
of both kingdoms were to deposit the embodied expression of their godly disposition.
It was there, then, that, in reality, the fruits of the opposite were lying, although,
as regards the place, they were offered elsewhere.&mdash;So much indeed is certain, that
the co-reference to Judah is necessarily required by the symbolical representation.
The rejection of Israel alone could not be symbolized by the destruction of the
temple. And no less does this appear from the announcement of salvation. For this
does not by any means promise the re-establishment of the Davidic dominion among
the people of Israel, but the restoration of the entire fallen Davidic government.
The tabernacle of David that is fallen refers to the destroyed temple. Both signify,
substantially, the same thing. With the destruction of the temple, the Davidic tabernacle
also fell; and its fall included the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel; for, in
this also, the Davidic race had still the dominion <i>de jure</i>, although it was
suspended <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p class="normal">The passage under consideration is remarkable also, inasmuch as
it furnishes a proof for the custom of designating the kingdom of God from its existing
seat and centre, and thus furnishes us, for other passages also, with the right
of freeing the thought from the figurative clothing.</p>
<p class="normal">A <i>further</i> reason against referring <i>the</i> altar to
the altar at Bethel, is, that the latter enjoyed no such pre-eminence in the kingdom
of Israel. The temple at Bethel was, to the ten tribes, by no means what the temple
at Jerusalem was to Judah. The law regarding the unity of the place of worship was,
among the ten tribes, regarded as non-existing. Even in the verse immediately preceding,
in viii. 14, Dan and Beersheba had been mentioned as the chief seats of the Israelitish
worship; and in chap. iv. 4, Gilgal appears beside Bethel as possessing the same
importance. In chap. v. 5, Bethel, Gilgal, and Beersheba are mentioned together.
Hosea, in chap. viii. 11, reproves Israel for having made many altars to sin. Hence,
there did not exist in Israel an altar <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>.
Such an altar existed only in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span> Judah. Nor had
the sanctuary at Bethel such importance, as that it could be considered as the spiritual
abode of the whole people.&mdash;<i>Hofmann</i> (<i>Weissagung u. Erfüllung</i>, S. 203)
raises the following objection against the reference to the altar at Jerusalem:&mdash;The
prophet, it is true, reproves the sins in Judah as well as those in Israel; but
it is only to the kingdom of Jeroboam that he announces destruction, while to the
house of David he promises that Jehovah would raise it up from its fallen condition.&quot;
But in opposition to this objection, we need only refer to ii. 5: &quot;And I send fire
in Judah, and it devours the palaces of Jerusalem.&quot; Passages such as i. 14, 15,
ii. 3, absolutely forbid us to make an exception of the palace of the king; and,
by chap. vii. 9, where destruction is announced to all the sanctuaries of Isaac,
we have as little warrant for excepting the temple. To assume any such exceptions,
would be contrary to the analogy of all other threatenings. <i>Hofmann</i> further
objects (l. c. S. 204), &quot;As the threatening announcement of the prophet had last
remained suspended over Israel, we are at liberty to think of the altar at Bethel
only.&quot; But already, in the third chapter, all Israel is addressed, according to
ver. 1; and we may further refer to v. 25, where likewise Israel can mean only the
whole people,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_370a" href="#ftn_370a">[2]</a></sup>
while in vi. 1, Judah is expressly mentioned beside Israel. The prophet employs,
throughout, the name of Israel with a certain ambiguity; so that it would be vain
to attempt to determine whether it be used in the wider, or in the more limited
sense. Wherever he wishes to be distinctly understood as speaking of the ten tribes,
he speaks of Joseph and Samaria. Still less would the prophet have employed the
names of Jacob (iii. 13, vi. 8, vii. 2, 6) and of Isaac (vii. 9, 16), which were
quite uncommon as a designation of the ten tribes,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_370b" href="#ftn_370b">[3]</a></sup>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 371]</span> if it had been of importance, and intentional
on his part strictly to separate the boundaries of Judah from those of Israel, and,
if there were not everywhere here, only a special application to the ten tribes
of that which concerned the whole who were connected by a common fate. But it is
especially suitable, that just the close of the whole should, in a remarkably distinct
manner, bring into view the two kingdoms, the destinies of which were so intimately
connected.&mdash;<i>Hitzig</i>, further, with a view to favour the reference to the temple
in Bethel, adduces the consideration that this vision is connected with the close
of viii. 14, and forms a kind of explanation of it. But we have here an entirely
new beginning, just as in chap. viii. in its relation to chap. vii. The three visions
are altogether independent of, and co-ordinate with each other.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1510;&#1489;</span>
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span> is commonly used of a prominent position
<i>at the side of</i>: Gen. xviii. 2; 1 Sam. iv. 20; compare
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span>
1 Kings xiii. 1. In Ezek. ix. 1 also, the angels stand at the side of the brazen
altar, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1510;&#1489;</span> can, of course, never signify &quot;<i>to
be suspended</i>.&quot;&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;</span> is a species of
ornament at the top of the pillars; and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,
&quot;the thresholds,&quot; are contrasted with each other, in order to give expression to
the thought that the building was to be shaken, and destroyed from the highest part
of it to the lowest,&mdash;from the top to the bottom. The shaking of the thresholds occurs
also in Is. vi. to denote that the shaking extended to the deepest foundations.
The greater number of interpreters translate: &quot;Strike the knop <i>so that</i> ...
tremble,&quot; etc.; but the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;</span> must be viewed
rather as co-ordinate with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1498;</span>: &quot;And they may
tremble,&quot; equivalent to &quot;Make to tremble.&quot;&mdash;The suffix in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501;</span> refers to the knops and threshold, or
to the entire building, which is marked out by the contrast of the highest and lowest
portions. According to <i>Ewald</i> and <i>Umbreit</i>, it is intended to refer
to the dashed pieces of the altar; but nothing has been said about the destruction
of the altar. In Ezek. ix. 2 likewise, the altar is mentioned, not because it was
to be destroyed, but only because there the guilt is heaped up. The casting down
does not, in itself, imply the <i>breaking</i>, <i>dashing into pieces</i>; it does
so only by its being connected with the following <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;</span>. The passage in Jer. xlix. 20 is analogous: &quot;He shall make their habitation
desolate over them;&quot; instead of: &quot;He shall thus make it desolate that they are buried
beneath its ruins;&quot; <span class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</span> compare Jer. l. 45.
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;</span>, properly understood, does not mean &quot;<i>upon</i>
the head;&quot; the head is rather represented as the receptacle of the tumbling ruins;
they fall into their heads and crush them; compare Ps. vii. 17. In what precedes,
there is no definite noun to which <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1500;&#1501;</span> refers.
This is to be explained by the dramatic character of the whole representation which
arises necessarily from the opening phrase: &quot;I saw.&quot; The same reason accounts for
the peculiarity of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1498;</span> being employed without
any designation of person. In his inward vision, the prophet sees the whole people
assembled before the Lord at the threshold of the temple. The Lord appears before
him as the judge, at the place of the transgressions, at the side of the altar.
At His command, the whole assembled multitude are buried under the ruins of the
temple. From this also it is evident that a destruction of the temple in a literal
sense cannot be entertained; for how could a whole people be buried under its ruins?
The same appears also from <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;</span> at the commencement.
This, then, shows that we have here before us a symbolical representation, corresponding
altogether to that which we have in vii. 1, 4, 7, viii. 1. Hitherto, the Lord speaking
to some one, had given him the commission of destruction. He now continues with:
&quot;I will kill.&quot; This also shows that the one who is addressed is the Angel of the
Lord. The same occurrence takes place in the greater number of the passages in which
the Angel of the Lord is spoken of. In the action there is constant alternation;
it is ascribed, at one time to Him, at another, to Jehovah.&mdash;Several interpreters
(<i>Marckius</i>, <i>De Wette</i>, <i>Rückert</i>, and others) explain
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span> by &quot;posterity;&quot; others, after the example
of the Chaldee (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;</span>), by &quot;remnant;&quot; and
others, by &quot;lowest of the people.&quot; We must here enter into a closer examination
of the significations of this word. It is commonly supposed (compare <i>Gesenius</i>
and <i>Winer</i>) that, primarily and properly, it signifies &quot;the last and extreme
part,&quot; and then &quot;the end.&quot; But that which is supposed to be the derived signification
is rather the original and proper one. The form of the word cannot furnish any reason
why this should not be the case, as is evident from what has been remarked by <i>
Ewald</i>: &quot;As the feminine termination, in general, forms abstract nouns, so also,
not unfrequently, abstract nouns are derived from other nouns, by means of the termination
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;</span>; very frequently there is no
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 373]</span> masculine in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1460;&#1497;</span> at all at the foundation, but
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</span> serves, in general, only as the sign
of derivation.&quot; The following reasons prove that the signification &quot;end&quot; is the
primary and proper one. 1. If the contrary were the case, the masculine
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1470;&#1460;&#1497;</span> would also occur, and the feminine would
be met with as an adjective also. 2. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514;</span>
forms the constant antithesis to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span>; but
it is universally admitted that the former is, originally and properly, an abstract
noun, and signifies &quot;beginning.&quot; The signification &quot;end&quot; must then be retained here
also. The word never has another signification (compare my work on Balaam, p. 465
ff.); it means only &quot;end&quot; in Its various relations. But the posterity cannot here
be thought of as the end; for the whole action is concentrated in one point of time.
Nor is the word ever used in the sense of &quot;posterity.&quot; With as little propriety
can &quot;end&quot; mean &quot;the lowest of the people;&quot; for one cannot see why just these should
be given up to the sword. &quot;End,&quot; here, rather denotes &quot;remnant,&quot;&mdash;all those who,
at the overthrow of the temple, might escape. These, the Lord will pursue with the
sword. They who were buried under the temple are the beginning,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514;</span>; the latter are the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span>, end. Corresponding to the shaking of
the temple from the knops to the thresholds, the thought is expressed in this manner,
that from the first to the last, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1500;&#1501; &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1492;</span>
they should be subjected to the divine punishment. An implied antithesis of quite
the same kind, of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;</span> to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514;</span> occurs also In iv. 2 (where <i>De Wette</i>
and <i>Rückert</i> have likewise mistaken the sense), and in viii. 10.&mdash;On the last
words of the verse, which are to be considered as a further explanation of, &quot;Their
end, or remnant, I will kill by the sword,&quot; <i>Cocceius</i> remarks: &quot;This slaughter
becomes the more thorough, inasmuch as even they who flee, or seemed to have fled,
are not excluded from it.&quot; The second member seems to contradict the first; for
if none be allowed to flee away, how can any have escaped? Several Interpreters
have been thereby induced to give to the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;</span>
the first time, the signification &quot;to escape,&quot;&mdash;the second time, &quot;to flee.&quot; But the
contradiction is quite similar to that which occurs in the preceding context also,
when all are dashed to pieces by the ruins, and yet a remnant is spoken of. It soon
disappears when we consider that it Is the intention of the prophet to cut off every
possible way of escape, by which carnal security endeavoured to save
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 374]</span> and preserve itself against the impression
of his discourse&mdash;that it is equivalent to: &quot;<i>All</i> shall be buried under the
ruins, and although some should succeed in escaping from this kind of destruction,
yet the sword of divine vengeance would be behind them, and slay them; flight shall
not be possible to any man; and even although it might be to some, it would be of
no avail to them, for God would be their persecutor.&quot; But another apparent contradiction
must not be overlooked. Even here, the destruction is most emphatically described
as being quite general; as such, it is minutely represented ins vers. 2-4. One cannot
fail to see how anxious the prophet is to cut off, from every individual, the idea
of the possibility of an escape. On the other hand, it is announced in ver. 8, that
the house of Jacob shall not be utterly destroyed; according to ver. 9, all the
godly shall be preserved; according to ver. 10, the judgment is to be limited to
the sinners from among the people,&mdash;a limitation which is also presupposed by the
description in the 11th and subsequent verses. In iii. 12, the preservation of a
small remnant amidst the general destruction had been promised. The greater number
of interpreters, in order to reconcile this apparent contradiction, assume an hyperbole
in vers. 1-4. But this assumption is certainly erroneous. The ground of this great
copiousness,&mdash;the reason why the prophet represents the same thought in aspects so
various,&mdash;is evidently to prevent every idea of an hyperbole,&mdash;to show that the words
are to be taken in all their strictness of meaning. But the limitation may be arrived
at, and effected in a different, and legitimate way. There is, in the nature of
ungodliness, a levity which flatters every individual with the hope of escape, even
although a threatened general calamity should take place. All the possibilities
of deliverance are sought after in such a disposition of mind, and are, by imagination,
easily changed into probabilities and realities, because just that is wanting which
proves them to be improbable and unreal, viz., the consciousness of a living, omnipotent
God. Thus men free themselves from fear, and with it, from the troublesome obligation
of escaping from it in another and a legitimate way, viz., by true conversion. Now,
it is this levity which the prophet opposes. He shows that whatever possibility
of deliverance such levity may dream of, it never would become a reality, and this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span> for the simple reason, that they had not to
deal with human antagonists; from them an escape by human means would be possible,
how powerful and wise soever they might be. But they have to deal with an omnipotent
God, who, being also omnipresent, can arm all His creatures against His despisers,
so that they cannot retreat to any place where He, who reigneth absolutely in heaven
and on earth, has not ministers of His vengeance. Every thought, then, of an escape
by <i>human means</i> is here cut off. But with this, every thought of deliverance
in any way is taken from the <i>ungodly</i>, who are told by their own consciences
that <span class="sc">God</span> will not deliver them. But, on the other hand,
the same consideration could not but administer consolation to the godly. If no
one, should he even hide himself in heaven, can escape from God the Avenger, then
no one, were he even in the midst of his enemies, and were the sword even already
lifted up against him, can be lost from God the Deliverer.&mdash;Another question has
been asked, which relates to the historical reference of the threatened punishment.
It goes just as far as the thought which lies at its foundation: &quot;You only have
I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I shall visit upon you all your
transgressions.&quot; Those interpreters who think exclusively of either the Assyrian,
or the Chaldean, or the Roman destruction, are, in the same way, partly right and
partly wrong, at the same time. All these events, and others besides, belong essentially
to one whole. The difference as to time and circumstances is that which is unessential.
That a prophet had exclusively in view any single one from among those divine manifestations
of punishment, can be asserted, only where he himself has given express declarations
to such an effect; and even then, the prophecy is limited to that single event,
as to its <i>form</i> only: its <i>idea</i> is not lost by the single fulfilment.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>If they break through into hell, from thence My hand
shall take them; if they ascend up into heaven, from thence I will take them down.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The Future must not, either here, or in what follows, be understood
as <i>potentialis</i>: &quot;Though they should conceal themselves;&quot; but as the real
Future: &quot;If they are to conceal themselves.&quot; That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1488;&#1501;</span> with the Future is used only <i>de re dubia</i>, as <i>Winer</i> asserts,
is as erroneous as to assert that, with the Preterite, <span class="pagenum">[Pg
376]</span> it supposes the condition as existing. The correct view has been already
given by <i>Gesenius</i> in the <i>Thesaurus</i>. By supposing the possibility of
a condition, impossible in reality, the denial of the consequence becomes so much
the more emphatic and expressive. That such a supposition is made here, is evident
from ver. 4, where the prophet passes over to the territory of actual possibility,
and where, therefore, we cannot translate: &quot;Though they should go.&quot; Such a supposition
is, in general, very frequent. It occurs, <i>e.g.</i>, Matt. v. 29, where <i>Tholuch</i>
(<i>Comment. on the Sermon on the Mount</i>) has been led very far astray from the
right understanding of <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#8000;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#955;&#956;&#8057;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965; &#8001; &#948;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#8056;&#962;

not indeed at liberty to translate, &quot;Though thy right eye should offend thee;&quot; but
it must be decided by other arguments, whether the condition here <i>supposed</i>
be one really possible; and these arguments show that it is only for the sake of
greater emphasis that there has here been supposed as possible, what is impossible.&mdash;Heaven
and Sheol form a constant contrast between the highest height and the lowest depth.
From a merely imagined possibility, the prophet descends to the real one. If, then,
even the former be not able to afford protection, because God&#39;s hand reaches even
where one has escaped far from any human power, how much less the latter!&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1514;&#1512;</span>
with the Accus. signifies &quot;to break through,&quot; Job xxiv. 16; with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>, &quot;to make a hole in anything;&quot; thus Ezek.
viii. 8, xii. 7, 12 (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1514;&#1512; &#1489;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, &quot;to make a
hole in the wall&quot;). These parallel passages show that the Sheol must be conceived
of as being surrounded with strong walls,&mdash;by which is expressed its inaccessibility
to all that is living. The fundamental passage is in Ps. cxxxix. 7, 8: &quot;Whither
shall I go from Thy Spirit, and whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend
up into heaven. Thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.&quot;
David does not here speak in his own person, but in that of his whole race. The
Psalm is an indirect exhortation to his successors on the throne, and at the same
time to the people. &quot;If you are wicked,&quot; so he here addresses them, &quot;you can never
hope to escape from the punishing hand of the Almighty.&quot; And since they have become
wicked, the words of David have acquired new emphasis.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 377]</span> <i>from thence I will search and take them
out; and if they hide themselves from My sight in the bottom, of the sea, from thence
I will command the serpent, and he bites them.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The question here is:&mdash;Why is Carmel specially mentioned? Interpreters
remind us of the numerous caves of this mountain, which make it peculiarly suitable
for concealment. <i>O. F. von Richter</i>, in the <i>Wallfahrten im Morgenlande</i>,
S. 65, remarks on this point: &quot;The caves are extremely numerous in Carmel, especially
on the west side. It is said that there are more than a thousand, and that they
were inhabited in ancient times by monks, to whom, however, their origin cannot
be ascribed. In one part of the mountain, called &#39;the caves of the members of the
orders,&#39; 400 are found beside each other. Farther down in the hard limestone mountain,
there is one which is distinguished by its size, about 20 paces long, and more than
15 broad and high.&quot; Details still more accurate are given by <i>Schulz</i> in the
<i>Leitungen des Höchsten</i>, Th. 5, S. 186, 303. According to him, the road is
pure rock, and very smooth, and so crooked, that those going before cannot see those
who follow them. &quot;When we were only ten paces distant from each other, we heard
each other&#39;s voices, indeed, but were invisible to each other, on account of the
winding ways made in consequence of the intervening by-hills.... Everywhere there
are caves, and their mouths are often so small that only one man can creep through
at a time; the approaches to them are so serpentine, that he who is pursued may
escape from his pursuer, and step into such a small opening, of which there are
frequently three or four beside each other, before his pursuer is aware of it. Hence,
if any one should hide himself there, it is exceedingly difficult, yea, even impossible
for the eyes of man to discover him who is pursued.&quot; But this circumstance alone
does not exhaust the case, even if we still further add that the mountain was then,
as it is now (<i>Richter</i>, S. 66), covered with trees and shrubberies up to the
summit. The expression, &quot;In the top,&quot; must not be overlooked, and the less so, since
it stands in evident antithesis to the &quot;<i>bottom</i> of the sea,&quot;&mdash;like the contrast
of height and depth in the preceding verse. Heaven and hell are represented on earth
by the top of Carmel, and the bottom of the sea. The height of Carmel must, therefore,
come also into consideration. This, it is true, is not very great; <i>Buckingham</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 378]</span> estimated it at 1500 feet (<i>v. Raumer</i>,
S. 40); but the prophet chose Carmel in preference to other higher mountains, partly
on account of the peculiarity already stated; partly, and especially, on account
of its position in the immediate neighbourhood of the sea, over which its summit
hangs, and which can be seen to a great distance from it; compare 1 Kings xviii.
43, 44. Of corporeal things it holds true, as it does of spiritual things, that
opposites, placed beside each other, become thereby more distinct. A lower elevation,
placed by the side of a depth, appears to the unscientific eye to be much higher
than another which is really so. Moreover, the position of Carmel at the extreme
western border of the kingdom of Israel must also be considered. He who hides himself
there, must certainly be ignorant of any safer place in the whole country; and if
even then there be no more security, the sea alone is left.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;</span>
occurs frequently with the signification &quot;to bid,&quot; to &quot;command.&quot; The word is chosen
on purpose to show, how even the irrational creatures stand in the service of the
omnipotent God; so that it requires only a word from Him to make them the instruments
of His vengeance. That the prophet had a knowledge of a very dangerous kind of sea-serpents
(of which <i>Pliny</i> xix. 4 speaks), need not be supposed on account of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1501;</span>. That was not of the slightest consequence
here. In v. 19 the serpent occurs in a particularizing representation of the thought
that God is able to arm all nature against His enemies: &quot;As if a man flees from
the lion, and a bear meets him; and he comes home, and leans his hand on the wall,
and a serpent bites him&quot;&mdash;just the opposite of the assurance that &quot;to those who love
God, all things shall work together for good.&quot; So early as in Deut. xxxii. 24, apostates
are threatened with the poison of the serpents of the dust, besides the teeth of
wild beasts; and what this threatening implied, might have been well known to Israel
from their former history; compare Num. xxi. 6: &quot;And the Lord sent against the people
serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died,&quot;&mdash;a passage to
which Jeremiah alludes in chap. viii. 17, where he says; &quot;For behold I send against
you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm, and they bite you, saith
the Lord.&quot; It is very probable that to this the prophet also alludes in the passage
before us.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span></p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>And if they go into captivity before their enemies,
from thence will I command the sword, and it slayeth them; and I set Mine eyes upon
them for evil and not for good.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1489;&#1497;</span> means the state of
exile. The circumstance of their being carried into captivity might awaken the hope
that mercy will be granted to them; for, according to the natural course of things,
he who is carried away into captivity may be sure of his life; but nothing can give
security before God. The last words are strikingly illustrated by <i>Calvin</i>,
who says: &quot;There is an antithesis in this sentence, inasmuch as God had promised
that He would be the protector of His people. But as hypocrites are always apt to
appropriate to themselves the promises of God, without having either repentance
or faith, the prophet here declares, that the eye of God would be upon them, not
to protect them, as was His custom, but rather to add punishments to punishments.
And this sentence is worthy of notice, inasmuch as we are thereby reminded, that
although the Lord does by no means spare infidels. He yet observes us more closely
in order to punish us the more severely, when He sees that we are utterly hardened
and incurable.&quot; Under any circumstances, the people of the Lord continue to be the
objects of special attention. They are more richly blessed; but they are also more
severely punished.</p>

earth, and it melteth, and all that dwell therein mourn; and it riseth up wholly

<p class="normal">The prophet continues to cut off every false hope with which levity
flatters itself. How can you think to escape, since you have the Almighty God for
your enemy! &quot;The prophet,&quot; remarks <i>Jerome</i>, &quot;speaks thus, in order to impress
them with the greatness of divine power, that they might not imagine that He would
perhaps not do what He had threatened, or that His power was not equal to His will.&quot;
Similar descriptions of the divine omnipotence, as opposed to unbelief and weak
faith, are very numerous; <i>e.g.</i>, iv. 13, v. 8, 27; Is. xl. 22, xlv. 12. We
are not at liberty to translate: &quot;And the Lord Jehovah of hosts is He who toucheth.&quot;
It is rather an abrupt mode of speech; and there must be supplied, either at the
beginning, &quot;And who is your enemy?&quot; or at the end, &quot;He is your opponent.&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span> This abruptness of language is quite in accordance
with the subject, and belongs, moreover, to the characteristic peculiarities of
Amos. Altogether similar is v. 7, 8, where Israel and their God are simply placed
beside each other, and every one is left to conclude for himself how such a God
would act towards such a people: &quot;They who turn judgment to wormwood, and cast righteousness
to the earth. Making the Pleiades and Orion, and turning the shadow of death into
the morning, and making the day dark with night, calling,&quot; etc. The accumulated
appellations. Lord, Jehovah, of hosts, likewise serve to point out the omnipotence
of God. The believer accumulates these appellations in his prayer in order to awaken
his confidence and hope; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Is. xxxvii. 16, where Hezekiah begins
his prayer to the Lord thus: &quot;Jehovah, of hosts, God of Israel, Thou who art enthroned
on Cherubim, Thou art God alone for all the kingdoms of the earth.&quot; But these appellations
are held up to the unbelievers, to cast down all their hopes. We have separated,
of hosts, from the preceding appellation of God by a comma. Ever since <i>Gesenius</i>,
in his Commentary on Is. i. 9, has asserted that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> when connected with Jehovah, must be considered as a Genitive depending
upon it, his view has been pretty generally adopted. But it is certainly erroneous.
The instances by which <i>Gesenius</i> endeavours to prove the possibility of such
a connection of proper names with appellative names are not to the point. In &quot;Bethlehem
Jehudah&quot; it is only by a false interpretation that Jehudah is considered as standing
in the <i>status constr.</i> with Bethlehem (compare the remarks on Mic. v. 1 [2]);
and with regard to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span> it is to be remarked
that, in consequence of its many divisions, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1501;</span>
loses the nature of a proper name. The two words, Jehovah Zebaoth, can no more be
immediately connected with each other than Jehovah (which is as perfect a proper
name as ever existed) ever has, or ever can have, the article. Let us only consider
the phrase <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> in Ps. lxxx. 15, and
elsewhere, where a <i>status constr.</i> is out of the question; and, <i>further</i>,
the fact that wherever, as in the case under review, Adonai precedes, the Mazorets
have always given to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> the points of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> but never of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;</span>; and let us, <i>finally</i>, consider
the far more frequent, full expression, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;
&#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> (<i>e.g.</i>, iii. 13, iv. 13, v. 14), and we shall be convinced,
that even where the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span> simple
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> occurs, not indeed
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;</span> is simply to be supplied (if such were
the case, why is it that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> never occurs
alone?), but that the notion of the Lord is to be taken from the preceding designations
of the sovereignty of God. Compare on <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span>
the remarks in my Commentary on Ps. xxiv. 10, where those also are refuted who,
like <i>Maurer</i> (in his Comment. on Is. i. 9), maintain that it had simply become
a name of God.&mdash;The manifestations of God&#39;s omnipotence are, after the general intimations
of it are given, just such as might now be expected; compare viii. 8. The <i>Fut.
with Vav Conv.</i> <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1490;</span> does not here denote
the Past, &quot;And it melted,&quot; but only the consequence of the preceding action, as
continuous as that: &quot;Who toucheth the earth, and it melteth.&quot; A dissolution of the
earth is to be thought of,&mdash;similar to that condition in which it was before the
days of creation, and similar to its condition during the great flood. Such a condition
of dissolution takes place also when the earth is visited by mighty kings desirous
of making conquests. &quot;Who toucheth the earth, and it melteth,&quot;&mdash;the truth of these
words Israel had <i>first</i> to learn by sad experience when the wild hosts of
Asshur were poured out over the West of Asia. The passage in Ps. xlvi. 7 is parallel,
where it is said: &quot;The heathen rage, kingdoms are shaken; He uttereth His voice
(which corresponds with, &#39;Who toucheth the earth,&#39; in the verse before us), and
the earth <i>melteth</i>.&quot; The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1490;</span>, &quot;to melt,&quot;
&quot;to dissolve,&quot; signifies, in that passage, the dissolving effect of the divine judgments,
the instruments of which are the conquerors. <i>Further</i>,&mdash;Ps. lxx. 4: &quot;The earth
and all the inhabitants thereof are melted,&quot;&mdash;by the success of the conqueror of
the world, the earth is, as it were, dissolved, and sunk back into the chaotic state
of primitive time.&mdash;The words, &quot;And it riseth up,&quot; are to be explained from the fact
that the earth, changed into a great stream, cannot be distinguished from the water
which covers it. The earth rises up, it is overflowed,&mdash;the earth sinks down, the
water subsides. The last clause of the verse must not be translated&mdash;as is done by
<i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Gesenius</i>, <i>Maurer</i>&mdash;It is overflowed as by the stream
of Egypt.&quot; This explanation is unphilological, and contrary, at the same time, to
the parallelism, which requires that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;</span>
be, both the times, understood in the same way. The verb
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1511;&#1506;</span> means only &quot;to sink,&quot; &quot;to sink down,&quot;
and is used of the subsiding water, Ezek. xxxii. 14; of the subsiding flame,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 382]</span> Num. xi. 2; and of a sinking town, Jer. li.
64. The last words thus rather contain the opposite of the clause immediately preceding.
But the sinking does not, by any means, signify a freedom from the waters, nor is
it to be conceived of as remaining. All which is expressed is the change only,&mdash;the
ebb takes the place of the flood, and <i>vice versa</i>. This, however, is, on the
dry land, a very sad condition. The inundation is here an emblem of hostile overflowing.
Water is frequently an emblem of enemies; compare Ps. xviii. 17, cxliv. 7. Overflowing
streams are emblematical of the crowds of nations, who, with a view to conquest,
overflow the whole earth. Is. viii. 7, 8, xvii. 12; Jer. xlvii. 2, xlvi. 7, 8, where
Egypt rises as the Nile, just as, in the case before us, the earth; with this difference,
however, that there the rising is an active, while here it is a passive one: &quot;Who
is this who riseth like the Nile, whose waters are moved as the rivers? Egypt riseth
up like the Nile, and his waters are moved like rivers, and he saith, I will go
up and cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof;&quot; Ezek.
xxxii. 14: &quot;Then will I make sink their waters, and cause their rivers to run like
oil,&quot; equivalent to: The conquering power of Egypt shall cease. Amos viii. 8 is
a parallel passage, in which, after the description of the prevailing sin, it is
said: &quot;Shall not the earth tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?
And it riseth up wholly like the Nile, and is agitated, and sinketh down like the
Nile of Egypt.&quot; The earthquake is the symbol of great revolutions, by which that
which is highest is turned upside down; compare Haggai ii. 21, 22: &quot;I shake the
heavens and the earth, and overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and destroy the strength
of the kingdom of the heathen;&quot; while the overflowing is emblematical of hostile
inundation, of visitation by war, in which the ebb succeeds the flood, and <i>vice
versa</i>.&mdash;In his negligent mode of writing&mdash;which frequently occurs in this book&mdash;the
prophet wrote <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1511;&#1492;</span> instead of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492;</span>, corresponding to the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492;</span> in the verse under consideration, just
as in the same verse he wrote <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1488;&#1512;</span> instead
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;</span>. The Mazorets, who everywhere disregarded
the peculiarities of the individual writers, have introduced the common form.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>Who buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and
His vault&mdash;over the earth He foundeth it: who calleth the waters</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span> <i>of the sea, and poureth them out over the
earth&mdash;Jehovah His name.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">That <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;</span> is here equivalent
to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;</span>, &quot;upper chambers&quot; (compare 1 Chron.
xvii. 17, where <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;</span> occurs with the signification
&quot;high place&quot;), is put almost beyond any doubt by the parallel passage, Ps. civ.
3: &quot;Who frameth with the waters His upper chambers.&quot; The fundamental passage is
Gen. i. 7: &quot;God made the vault, and divided between the waters which are under the
vault, and the waters which are above the vault.&quot; &quot;The waters, viz., the upper ones&quot;&mdash;thus
we have remarked in our commentary on that passage from the Psalms&mdash;&quot;are the material
out of which the structure is reared. To construct, out of the moveable waters,
a firm palace, the cloudy sky, firm as a molten looking-glass (Job xxxvii. 18),
is a magnificent work of divine omnipotence. The palace of clouds, as the upper
part of the fabric of the universe, gets the name <i>upper chambers</i> of God;
the lower part is the earth.&quot; As all the other manifestations of divine omnipotence
in vers. 5, 6, are such as are to be called into existence now, the upper chambers
and the vault will here come into consideration, in so far as from thence the torrents
of rain are poured forth; compare Ps. civ. 13, according to which the rain cometh
from the upper chambers of God; and Gen. vii. 11: &quot;The same day broke forth all
the fountains of the great flood (the last member of our verse), and <i>the windows
of heaven were opened</i>.&quot; From the upper chambers of God, whence once, at the
time of the deluge, the natural rain came down, the rain of affliction will now
descend.<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&mdash;&#1492;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&mdash;&#1513;&#1502;&#1493;</span> already occurred, <i>verbatim</i>,

<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1490;&#1506;</span> does to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1490;</span> and is equivalent to: &quot;Upon whose mere
word the waters of the sea cover the surface of the earth;&quot; compare Gen. vi. 17:
&quot;And, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth.&quot; The sea is the common
emblem of the heathen world; compare remarks on Ps. xciii., civ. 6-9. In chap. vii.
4, the &quot;great flood&quot; is contrasted with the &quot;lot&quot; in Deut. xxxiii. 9,&mdash;the heathen
world, with the people of God. The fire of war, which the Lord kindles, devours
both in the same way. Here, in contrast with the deluge, the conquering inundation
of the earth proceeds from the midst of the heathen world, stirred up by the Lord,
and destroys first of all unfaithful Israel, who, had they been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span> faithful to the Covenant, would have been
able to say, as in Ps. xlvi. 2-4, &quot;God is our refuge and strength, a help in trouble
He is found very much. Therefore will we not fear when the earth is overturned,
and the mountains shake in the midst of the sea; its waters roar and foam, mountains
tremble by its swelling.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 7. &quot;<i>Are you not as the sons of the Cushites unto Me, O
children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land
of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The prophet here deprives the people of another prop of false
security. They boasted of their election, by which God Himself, as they imagined,
had bound His hands. They considered the pledge of it&mdash;the deliverance from Egypt&mdash;as
a charter of security against every calamity, as an obligation to further help in
every distress, which God could not retract even if He would. A great truth lay
at the foundation of this error,&mdash;a truth which has been disregarded by the greater
number of interpreter&#39;s, who have, in consequence, forced upon the prophet a sense
which is altogether false.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_384a" href="#ftn_384a">[4]</a></sup>
The election of the people, and their deliverance from Egypt, were actually what
they considered them to be. God Himself had in reality thereby bound His hands;
He <i>was obliged</i> to deliver the people. He <i>could</i> not cast them off.
The election was an act of free grace; the manifestation of it in deeds was an act
of His righteousness. The people had a right to remind Him of His duty, when He
seemed not to perform it. Their election was then a firm anchorage of hope, a rich
source of consolation, the foundation of all their prayers. But the error consisted
in this, that the election was usurped by those to whom it did not belong,&mdash;an error
which is continually repeating itself, and which shows itself in a fearful form,
especially in the case of those who believe in the doctrine of Predestination. We
need, for example, refer only to <i>Cromwell</i>, who, in the hour of death, silenced,
by this false consolation, all the accusations of his <span class="pagenum">[Pg
385]</span> conscience. <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8052; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#8032;&#966;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150;</span>,
says the Apostle, in Rom. ii. 25, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#8048;&#957; &#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#8131;&#962;&#903;
&#7952;&#8048;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#965; &#8085;&#962;, &#7969; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053; &#963;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#945; &#947;&#8051;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</span>. The deliverance
from Egypt stands on the same footing as circumcision. The former also was profitable;
to those who showed themselves to be children of Israel, it afforded the certainty
that God would prove Himself to be their God. For those, however, who had become
degenerate, it entered altogether into the circle of ordinary events. For them,
it became something that had altogether passed away&mdash;that did not carry within itself
any pledge of renovation. This error is here laid open by the prophet, as he had
already done in v. 14: &quot;Seek good and not evil, that ye may live, and <i>thus</i>
the Lord, the God of hosts, be with you.&quot; He directs their attention to the fact,
that, in the Covenant-relation, which rests on reciprocity, the party who broke
the Covenant had nothing to ask, nothing to hope for. &quot;<i>Be not</i>,&quot; etc.; the
<i>tertium comparationis</i> is evidently the alienation from God. The &quot;children
of Israel&quot; (the appellation expressive of their dignity is intentionally chosen
in order to make more striking the contradiction between the appearance and the
reality) have become so degenerate, that they are no more any nearer to God than
the sons of the Cushites. Those interpreters who regard sin alone as the <i>tertium
comparationis</i> (<i>Cocceius</i> says: &quot;Ye are so alienated from Him, and so unfaithful,
that every one of you may be called a Cushite&quot;), give too limited a sense to the
expression. &quot;You are to Me,&quot; is rather equivalent to, &quot;I have not any more concern
in you, you stand not to Me in any other relation.&quot; But why are the Cushites alone
mentioned as an example of a people alienated from God? Their colour, perhaps, is
more to be considered in this, than their descent from Ham; the physical blackness
is viewed as an emblem of the spiritual. Thus they appear in Jer. xiii. 23: &quot;Will
indeed the Cushite change his skin, and the leopard his spots? will you indeed be
able to do good, who have been taught to do evil?&quot; But the fundamental passage is
the inscription of Ps. vii., where Saul, on account of his black wickedness, appears
under the symbolical name of Cush.&mdash;The right explanation of these first words furnishes,
at the same time, the key to the sound interpretation of the words which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 386]</span> follow: It is only for the Covenant-people
that the deliverance from Egypt is a pledge of grace. But you are no longer the
Covenant-people; your being brought up out of Egypt, therefore, stands on the same
line with the bringing up of the Philistines from their former dwelling-places in
Caphtor to their present abodes, and with the bringing up of the Syrians from Kir,
in which no one will see a pledge of divine grace, a preservative against every
danger, and, especially, an assurance of the impossibility of a new captivity. The
geographical inquiries regarding Caphtor and Kir would lead us too far away from
the subject which we are here discussing. The view which is now prevalent, and according
to which Crete is to be understood by the former, is in contradiction to the old
translations, which have Cappadocia, and with Gen. x. 14,&mdash;as long as, in that passage,
the Colchians are to be understood by the Casluhim. But that point would require
a minute investigation, which may be more suitably carried on at some other place.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 8. &quot;<i>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the
sinful kingdom, and I destroy them from off the face of the earth, saving that I
will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>The</i> sinful kingdom, whether its name be Israel or Judah,
or whether it be called Egypt or Edom. The holy God has not by any means, as you
in your blindness imagine, given you a privilege to sin. A difference exists between
Israel and the others in this respect only, that utter ruin does not take place
in the case of the former, as it does in that of the latter. For the distinction
between the people of God and other nations consists in this, that in the former,
there always remains a holy seed, an <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8053;</span>,
which the Lord must protect, and make the nursery of His kingdom, according to the
same necessity of His nature as that by which He extirpates the sinners of His people.
The &quot;sinful kingdom&quot; forms the contrast with the righteous kingdom; the article
being here used in a generic sense. Similar are Is. x. 6: &quot;<i>I send him against
impious people, and against the people of My wrath</i> (wheresoever there are such)
<i>I give him command</i>;&quot; and Ps. xxxiii. 12: &quot;Blessed is the nation whose God
is the Lord, the people whom He hath chosen for His inheritance;&quot; on which latter
passage <i>Michaelis</i> remarks, &quot;Blessed is the nation, whichsoever it may be.&quot;
The eyes of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span> the Lord are open upon <i>the</i>
sinful kingdom, and hence also upon the house of Jacob; it must be destroyed as
all others are, but it cannot be <i>destroyed like them</i>,&mdash;an idea which is prominently
brought out by the prefixed Infinit. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;</span>.
That is an erroneous interpretation which understands by the sinful nation, Ephraim,
and, after the example of <i>Grotius</i> (&quot;I will destroy the kingdom, not the people&quot;),
assumes that, by the house, in contrast with the kingdom, the people are intended.
Such a contrast betwixt the house and the kingdom would have required a more distinct
intimation. The house of Jacob, when referred to the ten tribes, is identical with
the kingdom. They were a house only in so far as they were a kingdom. But it is
both against the words (in Obad. ver. 17, &quot;house of Jacob&quot; is likewise used of the
whole of the nation), and against the connection, to refer it to the ten tribes.
When, however, it is referred to the whole, a contrast betwixt people and kingdom
can the less have place, as, according to ver. 11, the kingdom also shall be restored.&mdash;The
first part of the verse is almost literally identical with Deut. vi. 15: &quot;For a
jealous God is Jehovah, thy God, in thy midst; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God
be kindled against thee, and He destroy thee from off the face of the earth,&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;</span>. The prophet says nothing
new; he only resumes the threatening of the revered lawgiver.&mdash;The construction of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> is explained by the circumstance that, according
to the context, the eyes of the Lord can mean only His angry eyes&mdash;equivalent to
the anger of the Lord in the passage quoted from Deuteronomy; and the verbs and
nouns expressive of anger are connected by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>
with the object on which the anger rests; compare Ps. xxxiv. 17.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 9. &quot;<i>For behold I command and shake the house of Israel
among all the nations, as one shaketh in a sieve, and not shall anything firm fall
to the ground.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The figure in this verse is, upon the whole, plain; but some of
the particulars require to be explained, and to be more accurately determined. The
signification &quot;sieve,&quot; commonly assigned to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;</span>,
must be conceded to it. We must, however, here understand it of such a sieve as
serves similar purposes as a winnowing shovel, in which the corn is violently shaken,
and thus purified; and not of a sieve in which, by mere sifting, the corn is freed
from the dust which has remained after the first <span class="pagenum">[Pg 388]</span>
and proper cleansing. The latter is assumed by <i>Paulsen</i> (<i>vom Ackerbau der
Morgenländer</i>, S. 144), and, along with him, by the greater number of interpreters.
Such a sieve&mdash;a kind of fan&mdash;is mentioned in Is. xxx. 24, in addition to the winnowing
shovel. It occurs likewise in Luke xxii. 31, where <span lang="el" class="Greek">
&#963;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#8049;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> is <i>vanno agitare</i>. The LXX. also have here adopted the explanation,
not of an ordinary sieve, but of an instrument which serves the same purposes as

<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;</span>, which is indicative of a violent
procedure, and by the occurrence of the same figure in so many passages of Scripture;
compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Jer. li. 2; &quot;I will send against Babylon fanners that shall
fan her, and shall empty her land;&quot; Jer. xv. 7, and Matt. iii. 12; while the use
of the ordinary sieve for such a purpose is never mentioned, nor is it ever employed
for a figure.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;</span> is not to be translated,
&quot;<i>by</i> all nations,&quot; but, as the corresponding
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1499;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;</span> shows, &quot;in,&quot; or &quot;among all nations.&quot;
The many people are the spiritual sieve,&mdash;the means of purging. The Lord, whose instruments
they are, employs them for the destruction of the ungodly. They are taken away by
His secret judgments, for the execution of which He employs the heathen; compare
ver. 10. Even the godly are violently shaken; but the hand of the Lord secretly
upholds them that they may not sink, but that the temptation may serve for their
spiritual growth; compare Luke xxii. 31, 32, where the Lord distinctly alludes to
the passage under consideration. The corn is shaken; dust and impurity fall to the
ground, the chaff flies into the air. Many interpreters ascribe to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;</span> the signification, &quot;corn;&quot; others, &quot;little
stone.&quot; But these significations have been both assumed merely for the sake of the
context. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;</span>, from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;</span>, <i>colligavit</i>, <i>constrinxit</i>,
means, primarily, &quot;that which is tightly bound together;&quot; then, &quot;bundle,&quot; &quot;bag;&quot;
but here, as in 2 Sam. xvii. 13, &quot;that which is compact, firm, and solid,&quot; as opposed
to that which is loose, dissolved, and thin. That which is here meant is the solid,
firm corn, as opposed to the loose chaff, and the dust which falls to the ground
through the sieve.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 10. &quot;<i>By the sword, shall die all the sinners of My people
who say, The evil will not come near, nor advance to us.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span></p>
<p class="normal">In order that the preceding mitigation of the threatening of punishment
might not be appropriated by those to whom it did not belong, the prophet, before
passing on to the further detail of the promise, once more presents the threatening
in all its severity. &quot;The sinners who speak,&quot; etc., are they who usurped the promises
of the Covenant without having truly fulfilled its conditions,&mdash;who boasted of, and
trusted in, their belonging outwardly to the people of God (compare iii. 2), and
their zeal in the external performance of the duties of worship (compare v. 21-23);
and who therefore imagined that the judgments of the Lord could not reach them,
while, by their sins, they did all in their power to draw them down upon them, v.
18, vi. 3.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 11. &quot;<i>In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David
that is fallen, and wall up its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and build it as
the days of eternity.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;In that day,&quot; are to be understood quite generally,
viz., as referring to a time after the divine judgments have broken in and have
completed their work upon Israel. <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span>,
by which James renders it in Acts xv. 16, completely expresses the sense. The assertion
of <i>Baur</i>, &quot;That the prophet must have conceived of the restoration of the
tabernacle of David as being near at hand, because he recognised the instruments
of judgment in the invading Assyrians,&quot; falls to the ground along with the supposition
on which it rests. The prophet has nothing at all special to do with the invasion
of the Assyrians.&mdash;The Partic. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;</span>, according
to the usual signification of the Partic., expresses a permanent condition. The
very expression, &quot;tabernacle,&quot; suggests the idea of a sunken condition of the house
of David. The prophet sees the proud palace of David changed into a humble tabernacle,
everywhere in ruins, and perforated. The same idea is expressed by a different image
in Is. xi. 1. There the house of David is called the cut off trunk of Jesse, which
puts forth a new shoot. <i>Hofmann</i> and others are of opinion that the prophet
designates the house of David as a fallen tabernacle, on account of its abasement
at the time then present. &quot;At present,&quot; he says, &quot;the lofty house of David is a
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1505;&#1499;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;</span> when compared with the power of Jeroboam;
but the latter shall fall, and the former shall raise itself again from its decay.&quot;
But this designation is certainly not applicable to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 390]</span>
the house of David under a king like Uzziah, nor, in general, to the whole time
of the existing Davidic kingdom. The fact that Amos foresees the deep fall of Judah,
is placed beyond all doubt even by ii. 5. It is impossible that the announcement
of the restoration which is to <i>follow</i> only after this fall, should altogether
ignore the latter. This is, moreover, proved by the parallel passages. The predictions
of all the prophets are pervaded by the foresight of the Messiah&#39;s appearing at
the time of the deepest debasement of the Davidic dynasty, and after the total loss
of the royal dignity; compare the remarks on Mic. iv. 8, vi. (2); Is. xi. 1, liii.
2; Ezek. xvii. 22-24.&mdash;It might now appear as though the prophet here only supposed
the ruin of the house of David, without having, in the preceding context, expressly
mentioned it; but such is not the case. The whole of the preceding threatening of
punishment relates to the ruin of the house of David; for when the kingdom suffers,
the reigning family cannot but suffer also. This close connection of the two is
pointed out by the prophet himself in the subsequent words. The change of the suffixes
is there certainly not without a reason. The suffix in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;</span> refers to the two kingdoms; that in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span> to David; and that in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;</span> to the tabernacle, while the subject
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;</span> (ver. 12) is the people. By this
it is intimated that David, his tabernacle, the kingdoms, and the people, are in
substance one&mdash;that one stands and falls with the other. They who overlook the co-reference
to Judah, in the preceding verses, do not know what to make of the suffix in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;</span> (compare the expression &quot;these kingdoms,&quot;
used of Judah and Israel in vi. 2), and, in their uncertainty, conjecture sometimes
one thing and sometimes another.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;</span> is Nominat.,
not Accusat. The comparison is merely intimated; compare remarks on Hos. ii. 17.
The circumstance that the happy days of the times of David and Solomon are here
spoken of as &quot;days of eternity&quot;&mdash;of the remotest past (compare Mic. vii. 14)&mdash;implies
that the prophet sees a long interval between the present and the predicted event.&mdash;The
foundation of this prophecy is the promise to David in 2 Sam. vii.; compare especially
ver. 16: &quot;And thine house and thy kingdom shall be sure in eternity before thee,
and thy throne shall be firm in eternity.&quot; This reference has also been pointed
out by <i>Calvin</i>, who remarks: &quot;When the prophet says, &#39;as in the days of old,&#39;
he confirms <span class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</span> the doctrine that the dignity
of the house would not always flow in an equal current, but that, nevertheless,
there would always be such a restoration as would make it easily perceptible that
God&#39;s promise of an eternal dominion to David had not been in vain.&quot; The dominion
of David had already suffered a considerable shock by the separation of the two
kingdoms, existing at the prophet&#39;s time; but it was in future to sink even far
more deeply, and the people along with it. But, with all these things, God&#39;s promise
remains true. The judgments do not shut up the way for His mercy, but rather prepare
it. That it was only through the family of David that the promised salvation could
be imparted to the people, the prophet plainly declares. If it were not so, how
could he have identified the tabernacle of David with the two kingdoms, and with
the people? As to the person of the restorer, he does not more particularly designate
it. The main thing with him, as with Hosea (compare the remarks on Hos. ii. 2, and
iii. 5), is to impress upon the people of Israel the conviction, that salvation
could come to them only from a reunion with Judah&mdash;from their joining again the house
of David; compare Ezek. xxxvii. 22: &quot;And I make them one nation in the land upon
the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall
be no more two nations, and they shall be no more divided into two kingdoms.&quot; But
if this was sure and established, there could then be no more any doubt as to the
person. It was at that time generally known that the promise given to David would
be finally fulfilled in the Messiah; and it was generally acknowledged by the ancient
Jews, that the passages under consideration refer to the Messiah. <i>Jerome</i>
remarks: &quot;The Jews refer everything which, in this and the other prophets, is foretold
concerning the building up of Jerusalem and the temple, and the happy condition
of all things, to themselves, and foolishly expect that all shall be fulfilled in
a carnal sense.&quot; It is from the passage under review that the Messiah received the
name <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, <i>filius cadentium</i>&mdash;He
who springs forth from the fallen family of David; compare <i>Sanhedrin</i>, fol.
96, 2: R. Nachman said to R. Isaac, Hast thou heard when
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span> is to come? The latter answered:
Who is he? R. Nachman said: The Messiah. R. Isaac: But is the Messiah thus named?
R. Nachman: Certainly, in Amos ix. 11: <span class="pagenum">[Pg 392]</span> &quot;In
that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen.&quot; In <i>Breshith
Rabbah</i>, sec. 88, we read: &quot;Who would have expected that God should raise up
again the fallen tabernacle of David? And yet we read in Amos ix. 11, &#39;In that day,&#39;
etc. And who could have hoped that the whole world could yet become one flock? And
yet, such is declared in Zeph. iii. 9: &#39;Then will I turn to the people in pure lips,
that they all may call upon the name of the Lord, and serve Him with one lip.&#39; But
all that is prophesied only in reference to the Messiah.&quot; See <i>Schöttgen</i>,
p. 70, and other passages, especially from the <i>Sohar</i>, ibid. p. 111, 566.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. &quot;<i>In order that they may possess the remnant of Edom,
and of all the heathen upon whom My name is called, saith the Lord that doeth this.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Calvin</i> remarks on this verse: &quot;This main point is plainly
declared to us, that there is here promised an extension of the kingdom under Christ;
and it is just as if the prophet had said that the Jews were enclosed within narrow
limits, even when the kingdom of David did most flourish, inasmuch as, under Christ,
God is to extend their territory, so that they shall rule far and wide.&quot; There is
here an evident allusion to the times of David, which, in the last words of the
preceding verse, formed the subject of discourse. This is quite plain also from
the mention of the Edomites. These had been made subject by David; but afterwards,
availing themselves of the commencing fall of David&#39;s tabernacle, they had again
freed themselves. Not only they, however, but all the other heathen nations, shall
be again subjected to the raised up tabernacle of David. That former event served
as a type and prelude to the latter, and formed moreover a prophecy of it in deeds,
inasmuch as both rested on the same foundation, viz., God&#39;s protection of His Church,
and His care for His kingdom. It is for this reason too, that, with an allusion
to the former event, the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;</span> is chosen.
By this verb, expression is given only to the fact of their agreement, and to points
in which those events agree; but it gives no indication of <i>how far</i> they agree,
or in what respects they differ; this is to be declared in the subsequent words.
The prophet, however, in speaking only of the <i>remnant</i> of Edom, looks back
to the threatening in chap. i. They only who have been preserved in the judgment
which is there announced, are to come <span class="pagenum">[Pg 393]</span> under
the blissful dominion of the kingdom of David. As Israel, so also the Gentiles,
must be prepared for the coming of the kingdom of Christ by crushing judgments.
The judgment upon Israel is only a single portion of a great judgment upon all nations.
Into this connection it is brought by the very opening chapters of this book. In
chap. v. 8, vii. 7, there is likewise an intimation of great calamities and shakings,
which are to come upon the heathen world. The submission of the remnant of the heathen
world, however, will not be an abasement, but, on the contrary, an exalting of them;
this is shown by the words, &quot;Upon whom My name is called.&quot; These words do not allow
us to think of such a relation of Edom and the other nations to Israel, as existed
at the time of David in the case of the conquered nations. They are never used to
designate a form of allegiance to the Lord so low and false, but always denote the
relation of close and cordial allegiance. The heathen are in future to be considered
and treated as those who are consecrated to the Lord, and who belong to His holy
people,&mdash;just as Israel is now considered and treated. Compare, as to the use of
these words with reference to Israel, Deut. xxviii. 9, 10: &quot;The Lord shall raise
thee <i>an Holy people unto Him</i>, as He hath sworn unto thee ... and all people
of the earth see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and are afraid of
thee.&quot; In this verse, the expression, &quot;The name of the Lord is called upon thee,&quot;
corresponds with &quot;holy people.&quot; Jer. xiv. 9: &quot;And Thou, O Lord, art in the midst
of us, and Thy name is called upon us.&quot; Is. lxiii. 19: &quot;We are those over whom Thou
hast not reigned from eternity, and upon whom Thy name has not been called.&quot; As
regards the use of these words in reference to the temple, compare, further, Jer.
vii. 10, 11: &quot;And ye come and stand before Me in this house, upon which My name
is called. Is, perhaps, this house upon which My name is called, a den of robbers
in your eyes?&quot; The exceeding greatness of their wickedness is denounced in these
words; and the ground why it is so great, is not by any means the fact, that the
temple, as was indeed the case with that at Bethel, bore the name of the house of
God only by the caprice of the people, but that it really was the house of God,
and that God, in His gracious condescension, was there <i>really</i> present, as
a type of His dwelling in Christ; compare Deut. xii. 5: &quot;The place which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 394]</span> the Lord your God shall choose out of all
your tribes, to put His name there.&quot; <i>Finally</i>, These words are used in reference
to single individuals, whom God, in a special sense, has made His own, His representatives,
the bearers of His word, the mediators of His revelations, in Jer. xv. 16: &quot;I found
Thy words and I did eat them, and Thy words became unto me the joy and rejoicing
of my heart: for Thy name was called upon me, Jehovah, God of hosts,&quot; etc., equivalent
to, &quot;For I was the messenger and representative of Thee, the Almighty God.&quot;&mdash;<i>Hitzig</i>,
<i>Hofmann</i>, and <i>Baur</i> explain the expression, &quot;Upon whom My name is called,&quot;
by, &quot;Upon all the nations who once, at the time of David, were in subjection to
the people of God.&quot; The use of the Preterite has been urged in favour of this explanation;
but it is certainly very rash to assert, on the ground of this, that &quot;this view
alone is admissible according to the rules of grammar.&quot; The statement of <i>Ewald</i>,
§ 135 <i>a</i>, is exactly applicable to this case: &quot;The <i>Perfectum</i>, when
used with reference to some future event, either mentioned or conceived of, may
as well indicate the past which <i>then</i> has taken place.&quot; The sense might thus
be: &quot;All the heathen upon whom then My name will be called.&quot; In the same sense,
the Preterite is used in another passage, quoted by <i>Hofmann</i> for a different
purpose&mdash;viz., 2 Sam. xii. 28: &quot;In order that I may not take (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1499;&#1491;</span>)
the city, and my name be called (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;</span>) upon
it.&quot; It militates, however, against their view, that the name of the Lord being
called upon any one, has, according to all the parallel passages, a sense too profound
to admit of a relation to the Lord so loose and external being thereby designated.
It is used only of such as are received into the condition of the people and sons
of Jehovah, Hos. ii. 1 (i. 10). <i>Further</i>, The mere restoration of the Davidic
dominion over the heathen is a very meagre thought, which is far from coming up
to what Jacob had foretold in Gen. xlix. 10, and to what David and Solomon expected
of the future; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Ps. lxxii. 11: &quot;And all kings worship Him,
all the heathen serve Him.&quot;&mdash;The closing words, &quot;Thus saith the Lord that doeth this,&quot;
are intended to strengthen faith in a promise which appears to be incredible, by
calling attention to the fact, that the person who promises is also the person who
carries it out to its fulfilment; compare Jer. xxxiii. 2: &quot;Thus saith the Lord that
makes it, the Lord that forms it, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</span> to carry
it out, the Lord is His name.&quot; This closing formula is also very ill suited for
so meagre a prediction as that of the restoration of the old borders, of which Israel,
under the reign of Uzziah and Jeroboam, was not so very far short. It was, probably,
solely from a false interpretation of the passage under review, that an important
historical event had its rise. Hyrcanus compelled the Idumeans, who were conquered
by him, to be circumcised, and in that way to be incorporated into the Theocracy;
so that they lost entirely their national existence and name (<i>Jos. Arch.</i>
xiii. 9, 1; <i>Prideaux Hist. des Juifs</i>, vol. v. p. 16). This proceeding differed
so materially from that which was ordinarily followed&mdash;for David did not think it
at all necessary to adopt a similar proceeding against the Idumeans, and the other
nations which were conquered by him&mdash;that it necessarily requires some special reason
to account for it; and such a reason is furnished by the passage under consideration.
Hyrcanus washed to be instrumental in the fulfilment of the prophecy contained in
it; but in this he failed. He did not consider, 1. That the reception of Edom into
the kingdom of God is here brought into connection with the restoration of the tabernacle
of David, and hence could be brought about only by a king of the house of David.
He did not consider, 2. That the matter here in question is not such a reception
into the kingdom of God as depends upon the will of man, but a spiritual reception,
which carries along with it the full enjoyment of divine blessings. That it was,
however, easy for Hyrcanus to fall into such a mistake, is shown by the example
of <i>Grotius</i>, who confined himself to this merely apparent fulfilment, although
he had the real fulfilment before his eyes. By a similar misunderstanding of Old
Testament prophecies, other important events also were brought about; <i>e.g.</i>,
according to the express testimony of Josephus, the building of the Egyptian temple,
and, as we shall afterwards see, the building of the temple by Herod.</p>
<p class="normal">It now only remains to consider the quotation of this passage
in the New Testament, in Acts xv. 16, 17. <i>Olshausen</i> has directed attention
to a difficulty regarding it, which has been overlooked by the greater number of
interpreters. He says that one cannot well see how the quotation bears upon the
point at issue. Both parties were at one as to the duty of admitting the Gentiles
into the kingdom of God. The only question was <span class="pagenum">[Pg 396]</span>
about the manner of their reception&mdash;whether with, or without, circumcision&mdash;and as
to this, the prophecy, which confines itself to the fact only, does not contain
any express declaration. But this difficulty has its sole foundation on the erroneous
view that James was stating two reasons altogether independent of each other;&mdash;the
first in ver. 14, God&#39;s declaration by facts, in His having given His Holy Spirit
to the Gentiles, without their having been circumcised; and then, in vers. 16, 17,
the testimony of the Old Testament. But the sound view rather is, that both together
form only one reason. Apart from that testimony which God, the Searcher of hearts,
had given to the Gentiles by the gift of the Holy Spirit, and by making no difference
betwixt them and Israel, the prophetic declaration would have been without any significance;
but it acquires this significance when combined with the testimony of God. It is
now also that the silence of James, in reference to that condition which was demanded
by those of a pharisaic tendency, gains significance. Simeon has declared how God
at first was pleased to take a people for His name out of the Gentiles; and after
the <i>fact</i> of their reception has been so expressively declared, the Old Testament
passage, where this reception is spoken of, is not cognizant of any other <i>mode</i>.
The Apostle does not content himself with quoting ver. 12; he first cites ver. 11,
because it furnished the proof that the declaration contained in ver. 12 referred
to that time. That event, with which the conversion of the Gentiles is here immediately
connected, had already taken place in Christ, at least as to the germ, which contained
within itself the whole substance which afterwards displayed itself. But it was
the main thought only which came into consideration in ver. 11, and therefore it
is somewhat abbreviated. In the quotation, the translation of the LXX. evidently
forms the foundation.</p>
<p class="normal">The quotation of ver. 12 agrees, almost <i>verbatim</i>, with
the LXX. It follows them in their important deviation from the Hebrew text. Instead
of, &quot;In order that they may occupy the remnant of Edom,&quot; the LXX. read,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#960;&#969;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#963;&#7985; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957; &#956;&#949;</span>
(instead of <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#949;</span> Luke has
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, which is found in the <i>Cod. Alex.</i>
also, but has very likely come in from Luke). It is of very little consequence to
determine in what manner the translation of the LXX. arose; whether they had a different
reading, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493; &#1513;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;</span>,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 397]</span> before them; or whether they merely read erroneously;
or whether, according to <i>Lightfoot</i> (in his remarks on Acts xv. 16, 17), they
intentionally thus altered the words; or whether it was their object to express
the sense only generally and approximately (in the last two cases we should be obliged
to suppose that, by a kind of play, and in order to represent, in an outward manner,
the substantial agreement of the thought, they chose words exactly corresponding
to the Hebrew text, with the exception of a change of a few letters,&mdash;a thing which
frequently occurs in the Talmud, and even in Jeremiah when compared with the older
prophets); only, we must set aside the idea of a really different reading,&mdash;a reading
resting on the authority of good Manuscripts, inasmuch as such an idea would be
irreconcilable with the deviations of the LXX. elsewhere, and with the unanimity
of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the passage before us. The assertion of <i>Olshausen</i>,
however, that, in the Hebrew form, the passage would not have been suitable for
the purpose, and that therefore it is probable that, on this occasion, Greek must
have been spoken in the assembly, does indeed deserve our attention.</p>
<p class="normal">Whether or not the latter was the case, we leave undecided. That
it was probable, may be proved from other grounds, but it by no means follows from
the reason stated by <i>Olshausen</i>. The passage was suited for the proof, as
well according to the Hebrew text, as according to the Alexandrian version; for
the latter is quite correct and faithful in so far as the sense is concerned. The
<i>occupying</i>, in the sense in which it is used by Amos, has the <i>seeking</i>
for its necessary supposition. For how, indeed, can spiritual possession, spiritual
dominion by the people of the Lord exist, unless the Lord has been sought by those
who are to be ruled over? Compare the declaration: &quot;The isles shall wait for His
law,&quot; Is. xlii. 4. The words, &quot;And of all the heathen,&quot; following immediately after
Edom, evidently prove that Amos mentions Edom, only by way of individualizing; and
the Idumeans, especially, as a people, only because their former, specially violent
hatred to the Covenant-people (compare i. 11) made their future humble submission
more evidently a work of the omnipotence of God, and of His love watching over His
people; and at the same time there may be a reference also to the former subjection
by David. The LXX. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 398]</span> have done nothing more,
than at once to substitute for the particular, the general which comprehends this
particular,&mdash;a particular which is, by Amos too, designated as a part of the general.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_398a" href="#ftn_398a">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 13. &quot;<i>Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and the ploughman
reacheth to the reaper, and the treader of the wine-press to him that soweth seed.
And the mountains drop must, and all the hills melt.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The fundamental thought in this passage is this:&mdash;Wheresoever the
Lord is, there also is the fulness of His gifts.&mdash;The imagery in the first hemistich
is taken from Lev. xxvi. 3-5: &quot;If ye shall walk in My laws, and keep My commandments
and do them; then I will give your rains in their seasons, and the land gives its
produce, and the tree of the field gives its fruit. And your threshing <i>reaches</i>
to the vintage, and the vintage <i>reaches to the sowing</i> time.&quot; After the Lord
has purified His congregation by His judgments, then the joyful time of blessing,
prophesied by His servant Moses, shall likewise come. <i>Cocceius</i> says: &quot;One
shall reap, the other shall immediately plough; one shall scatter the seeds in the
ploughed field, while another shall, at the same time, tread the grapes,&mdash;a work
is wont to be done at the last time of the year. There shall be continual work,
and continual fruit, and a fruitfulness such as that in the land of the Troglodytes
which <i>Scaliger</i> (<i>Exercit.</i> 249, 2) thus describes: &#39;Throughout the whole
year there is sowing and reaping at the same time; at one place the seed is committed
to the fields, and at another the wheat shoots up, at another it gets ears, at another
it is reaped, at another it is collected, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 399]</span>
brought to the threshing-places, and thence to the barn.&#39;&quot;&mdash;The second hemistich
agrees with Joel iv. (iii.) 18 (which is certainly not accidental; compare the introduction
to Joel): &quot;At that time the mountains shall drop must, and the hills go with milk.&quot;
From a comparison of this passage it appears that the melting of the hills can mean
only their dissolving into rivers of milk, must, and honey, with an allusion to
the description of the promised land in the Pentateuch (Exod. iii. 8) as a land
flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 14. &quot;<i>And I turn Myself to the captivity of My people Israel,
and they build waste cities, and dwell, and plant vineyards, and drink their wine;
and they make gardens and eat their fruit.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The captivity is a figure of misery. With reference to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1493;&#1489;</span> compare the remarks on Joel.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 15. &quot;<i>And I plant them in their land, and they shall no
more he plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy
God.</i>&quot; Compare p. 227 seqq.</p>

<hr class="W20">
<h2><a name="div2_399" href="#div2Ref_399">THE PROPHECY OF OBADIAH.</a></h2>
<p class="normal">We need not enter into details regarding the question as to the
time when the prophet wrote. By a thorough argumentation, <i>Caspari</i> has proved,
that he occupies his right position in the Canon, and hence belongs to the earliest
age of written prophecy, <i>i.e.</i>, to the time of Jeroboam II. and Uzziah. As
bearing conclusively against those who would assign to him a far later date, viz.,
the time of the exile, there is not only the indirect testimony borne by the place
which this prophecy occupies in the collection of the prophets which is chronologically
arranged, but there are also the following facts;&mdash;that those who are to inflict
the predicted calamity upon Judah are not at all more definitely characterized than
in the first part of Hosea, in Joel, and Amos;&mdash;that, in like manner, the heathen
power from which the overthrow of Edom is to proceed, is neither mentioned, nor
more definitely pointed out in any other way;&mdash;that Jeremiah already made use of
Obadiah&#39;s prophecy; and if such be denied, the older foundation would then be withdrawn
from the prophecy of Jeremiah&mdash;which would be contrary <span class="pagenum">[Pg
400]</span> to the analogy of Jeremiah&#39;s prophecies against foreign nations;&mdash;and,
finally, that, in vers. 12-14, the prophet exhorts the Edomites neither to rejoice
nor to co-operate in the destruction of Jerusalem, because, otherwise, they would
certainly receive the well-merited reward of such wickedness committed against the
Covenant-people, to whom they were so nearly related. Such an exhortation would
have been out of place, after the wickedness had been committed.&mdash;The view of <i>
Hofmann</i> (which was revived by <i>Delitzsch</i> in his treatise, &quot;When did Obadiah
prophesy?&quot; [<i>Guerike&#39;s Zeitschrift</i> 51, <i>Hft.</i> 1])&mdash;according to which
the capture of Jerusalem by the Philistines and Arabians under Jehoram (2 Chron.
xxi. 16 ff.) was the occasion of the prophecy before us, and according to which
Obadiah is thus made the oldest among all the prophets in the Canon, and separated
by nearly a century from the three prophets who preceded him&mdash;overlooks the fact
that only cogent reasons could induce us to assume so isolated a position, since
it is certainly not a matter of accident that the written prophecy began its course
under the reign of Jeroboam and Uzziah. The guilt and punishment of Edom are, in
like manner, spoken of in the Preterite; and it is inadmissible to understand the
Preterites as historical, in so far as they refer to the guilt, and as prophetical,
in so far as they refer to the punishment. The words, &quot;Day of their destruction,&quot;
in ver. 12, are decisive against every other catastrophe upon Judah, but that of
the Chaldean. Ver. 20, when rightly interpreted, supposes the carrying away of Israel
and Judah, and hence allows us to think only of the Assyro-Chaldean catastrophe.
In ver. 21, Mount Zion is forsaken, and &quot;the saviours&quot; return to it from the land
of captivity.</p>
<p class="normal">In strict accordance with the position of the book in the Canon,
is the fact, that Obadiah connects himself most closely with Joel, and, excepting
him, among all the prophets, with Amos only; compare <i>Caspari</i>, S. 20 ff.,
35; <i>Hävernick</i>, <i>Einleitung</i> II. S. 318. Of greater importance than the
coincidences in particulars, is the fact that the prophecy of Obadiah, upon the
whole, connects itself most closely and immediately with the fourth (third) chapter
of Joel&mdash;that in the prophecy of Obadiah, we have indeed a <i>variation</i> on that
chapter. The judgment upon Judah, which Joel announces in the first part,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 401]</span> is here supposed to have already taken place;
and this might be done so much the rather, because, even in Joel, the prophetic
<i>Plerophory</i>, with which rationalistic interpreters are so much puzzled, has
changed the Future into the Present and Past&mdash;as, even there, the destruction of
Jerusalem, and the overflowing of the whole country by the heathen, are represented
as already existing. It is only the judgment upon the heathen, and the restoration
of Israel, which Obadiah represents in his prophetic picture.</p>
<p class="normal">Like Hosea (in the first three chapters), Joel, and Amos, so Obadiah
also, received the mission to point out the catastrophe threatened by the world&#39;s
power, even before the latter existed on the scene of history. It was to the Covenant-people
a source of rich consolation that it was so clearly and distinctly foretold to them,
even before it had an existence, and the points of view from which it must be regarded
were opened up to them. He, however, distinctly points to one idea only, just because
there were already predecessors to whose prophecies he could refer. He did not receive
the mission to call to repentance, or to represent the judgment as a well-deserved
punishment&mdash;although, <i>indirectly</i>, in him as well as in Joel, these thoughts
also occur, as certainly as the supposed destruction of Judah and Israel could only
be the punishment of their sin; he has to point out only the salvation subsequent
to the overflowing by the heathen world, the conquering power of the kingdom of
God which, in the end, will manifest itself, and deeply to impress upon the Covenant-people
the words: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;, &#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#957;&#949;&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#951;&#954;&#945; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957;.</span>
The glaring contrast betwixt the <i>idea</i>&mdash;according to which the kingdom of God
was to be all prevailing&mdash;and the <i>reality</i>, in which it is pressed into a corner,
shall in future increase still more. Even from this corner, the people of God shall
be driven. But death is the transition to life; the uttermost degree of sufferings,
the forerunner of deliverance and salvation. Not a restoration only is in store
for the people of God&mdash;they even obtain the dominion of the world; but to the heathen
world, which is at enmity with God, their exaltation is a forerunner of destruction.</p>
<p class="normal">All which Obadiah had to say in reference to the heathen, God-hating
world, and to the form which, in future, Israel&#39;s <span class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</span>
relation to it would assume, has been exemplified by him in the case of Edom. For
the fact, that it is only the heathen power individualized which we have before
us, is shown by the transition to the heathen in general in ver. 15, according to
which, Edom comes into consideration only as a part of the whole: &quot;For near is the
day of the Lord upon <i>all the heathen</i>.&quot; So also is it in ver. 16: &quot;For as
ye<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_402a" href="#ftn_402a">[1]</a></sup> have
drunk upon My holy mountain, so shall <i>all the heathen</i> drink continually;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_402b" href="#ftn_402b">[2]</a></sup>
and they drink, and sup up, and they are as though they were not.&quot; When speaking
of the guilt, he mentions Edom only; when speaking of punishment, he introduces
all the heathen at once. According to ver. 17, Israel shall occupy the possessions
of <i>all the heathen</i>. And even the last words of the whole prophecy, &quot;And the
kingdom shall be the Lord&#39;s,&quot; show that it bears a universal character,&mdash;that in
the case of Edom, we have only a principle exemplified which applies to all the
enemies of the kingdom of God. The leading thought is: The kingdom of God shall
obtain universal dominion, which follows the deepest abasement of the people of
God, and of which the fullest and most perfect realization must be sought in Christ.</p>
<p class="normal">The animating thought could be so much the better individualized
in the case of Edom, as its natural relation to Israel was one of special nearness,
and its hatred specially deep; and as, moreover, it at all times considered itself
the rival of Israel, of whose advantages it was envious. That which Amos, the cotemporary
of Obadiah, says of Edom in chap. i. 11&mdash;&quot;He pursues his brother with the sword,
and corrupts his compassions, and his anger tears perpetually, and he keeps his
wrath for ever&quot;&mdash;shows how exceedingly well he was fitted to be a representative
of the enemies of the kingdom of God. It was so much the more obvious thus to represent
Edom as a particular and individualizing exemplification of this principle, as the
prophets of that period had not as yet received any more definite disclosures as
to the threatening kingdoms of the future, while Edom, in his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 403]</span> hatred against the people of God, stood before
their eyes. The germ of this is to be found in Joel iv. (iii.) 19, where Edom already
appears as a representative and type of the God-hating heathen world, which is to
be judged by the Lord, after the judgment upon Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">In Obadiah, we find a fulness of remarkable glances into the future
compressed within a narrow space. The chief events are the following:&mdash;1. The capture
of Jerusalem, the total carrying away of the entire people, both of Judah and Israel,
to a far distance, vers. 20, 21. 2. The return of Israel, the cessation of the separation
of the two kingdoms, ver. 18 (compare Hos. ii. 2 [i. 11]; Amos ix. 11, 12), and
his elevation to the dominion of the world by the &quot;Saviours,&quot; ver. 21. 3. The judgment
upon Edom by heathen nations, vers. 1-9. Jeremiah, in xxvii. 2 ff., compared with
xxv., more distinctly points out the Chaldeans as the heathen instruments of the
judgment upon Edom and all the people round about; and Matt. i. 3, 4, shows the
weight of the sufferings which were inflicted by them upon Edom. 4. The occupation
of the land of Edom by Judah. One realization of this prophecy took place in the
time of the Maccabees; but we must not confine ourselves to this. As, in the main,
Edom is only a type of the God-hating heathen world, the true and real fulfilment
can be sought in Christ alone. Compare the remarks, p. 98, with reference to Moab
in Balaam&#39;s prophecy.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophecy of Obadiah is divided into three parts:&mdash;the destruction
of Edom by heathen nations summoned by Jehovah, vers. 1-9; the cause of it, his
wickedness against Judah, vers. 10-16; Judah, on the contrary, rises with Joseph
from this humiliation, and becomes a conqueror of the world, vers. 17-21. This last
part claims our closer consideration.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 17. &quot;<i>And upon Mount Zion shall be they that have escaped,
and it is holy</i> (compare Joel iii. 5, iv. 17 [ii. 32, iii. 17]), <i>and the house
of Jacob occupies their possessions.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The suffix in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;</span> refers
to all the heathen in ver. 16. The kingdom shall be the Lord&#39;s, according to ver.
16, and the dominion of His people extends as far as His own. We have here the general
prophecy; and in what immediately follows, the application to Edom. The first two
clauses serve as a foundation for the third. The holiness has, so to speak, not
only a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span> defensive, but also an offensive character.
Its consequence is the dominion of the world.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 18. &quot;<i>And the house of Jacob becomes a fire, and the house
of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble, and they kindle them, and devour
them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for the Lord has
spoken.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Besides the whole of the people, that part of them (the house
of Joseph, the people of the ten tribes) is specially mentioned which one might
have expected to be excluded. That there is none remaining to the house of Esau
(and to all who are like him) agrees with the declaration uttered by Joel in iii.
5 (ii. 32): &quot;Amongst those who are spared, is whomsoever the Lord calleth.&quot; They,
however, whom the Lord calls, are, according to the same verse, they who call on
the name of the Lord. But the characteristic of Edom is his hatred against the kingdom
of God,&mdash;and that excludes both the calling on the Lord, and the being called by
the Lord. The single individual, however, may come out of the community of his people,
and enter into the territory of saving grace, as is shown by the example of Rahab.
In the further description of the conquering power, which the people of God shall,
in future, exercise, we are, in ver. 19, first met by Judah and Benjamin.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 19. &quot;<i>And they of the south possess the Mount of Esau,
and they from the low region, the Philistines; and they</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, they of
Judah, the whole, of whom they of the South and of the low region are parts only)
<i>possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria, and Benjamin&mdash;Gilead.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It is obvious that we have here before us only an individualized
representation of the thought already expressed in Gen. xxviii. 14: &quot;And thy seed
shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt break forth to the East and to
the West, to the North and to the South; and in thee, and in thy seed, all the families
of the earth are blessed;&quot; compare also Is. liv. 3: &quot;Thou shalt break forth on the
right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles.&quot;&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1490;&#1489;</span>
is the south part of Judea, at the borders of Edom;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;</span> the low region on the West, at the borders
of the Philistines. As, according to the vision of the prophet, the exaltation of
Judah is preceded by his total overthrow and captivity (compare vers. 11-14, 20,
21), the tribe of Judah, which, before the catastrophe, was settled in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 405]</span> the South and low region, is here meant. That
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;</span> can be taken only as the sign of the Accus.,
and &quot;Mount of Esau,&quot; accordingly, as the object only, appears from ver. 20, according
to which the South is vacant. Judah thus extends in the South, over Edom, in the
West, over Philistia, in the North, over the former territory of the ten tribes,
and hence also over the territory of Benjamin, which formerly lay betwixt Judah
and Joseph. Benjamin is indemnified by Gilead. The whole of Canaan comes thus to
Judah and Benjamin. Joseph, to whose damage, according to ver. 18, this enlargement
of Judah&#39;s territory must lead, must be transferred altogether to heathenish territory.
We expect to find, in ver. 20, how he is indemnified.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 20. &quot;<i>And the exiles of this host of the children of Israel
(shall possess) what are Canaanites unto Zarephath, and the exiles of Jerusalem
that are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the South.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The circumstance that the Athnach stands below
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491;</span> indicates that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;</span> implies the common property of the exiles
of this host, and of the exiles of Jerusalem. The &quot;Sons of Israel,&quot; in this context,
can only be the ten tribes; for they are here indemnified for their former territory,
which, according to ver. 19, has become the possession of Judah. &quot;The exiles of
this host&quot; is equivalent to: &quot;This whole host of exiles,&quot;&mdash;the whole mass of the
ten tribes, carried away according to prophetic foresight (compare Amos v. 27: &quot;And
I carry you away beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts&quot;), as opposed
to a piecemeal carrying away, such as had once already taken place before the time
of the prophet in respect to Judah, but not in respect to the children of Israel;
compare Joel iv. (iii.) 6. That the &quot;Canaanites unto Zarephath&quot;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
Ph&#339;nicians, whose territory formed part of the promised land, but had never, in
former times, come into the real possession of Israel&mdash;are the objects of conquest,
and that, hence, we cannot explain as <i>Caspari</i> does, &quot;Who are among the Canaanites,
even unto Zarephath,&quot; is evident from the circumstance, that all the neighbouring
nations appear as objects of the conquering activity;&mdash;that the great mass of the
Israelitish exiles were not among the Canaanites;&mdash;that the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> could, in that case, not have been omitted;&mdash;and
that the South country is too small <span class="pagenum">[Pg 406]</span> a space
for the children of Israel, and of Jerusalem together. Sepharad, the very name of
which is scarcely known, is mentioned as a particularizing designation of the utmost
distance. The description becomes complete by its returning to the South country,
from which it had proceeded. The South country penetrates to Edom; the inhabitants
of Jerusalem extend beyond the South country.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 21. &quot;<i>And saviours go up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount
of Esau, and the kingdom shall be the Lord&#39;s.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;</span> is to be accounted for
from the consideration, that the deliverance and salvation imply the entire overthrow&mdash;the
total carrying away of the people. The Saviour <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125;
&#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span> is hidden beneath the &quot;saviours;&quot; compare Judges iii. 9, 15; Neh.
ix. 27. But even here, everything is connected with human individuals; and the more
glorious the salvation which the prophet beholds in the future, viz., the absolute
dominion of the Lord, and His people, over the world, the less can it be conceived
that the prophet should have expected the realization of it by a collective body
of mortal men without a leader. But the plural intimates that the antitype is not
without types,&mdash;that the head cannot be conceived of without members. In Jer. xxiii.
4, we read: &quot;And I raise up shepherds over them which shall feed them;&quot; and immediately
afterwards the one good shepherd&mdash;Christ&mdash;forms the subject of discourse.&mdash;And the
kingdom shall be the Lord&#39;s.&quot;&mdash;His dominion, till <i>then</i> concealed, shall now
be publicly manifested, and the people of the earth shall acknowledge it, either
spontaneously, or by constraint. The coming of this kingdom has begun with Christ,
and, in Him, waits for its consummation. The opinion of <i>Caspari</i>, that the
contents of vers. 19 and 20, as well as the close of this prophecy, belong altogether
to the future, rests on a false, literal explanation, the inadmissibility of which
is sufficiently evident from the circumstance that the Edomites, Philistines, and
Canaanites have long since disappeared from the scene of history; so that there
exists no longer the possibility of a literal fulfilment.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_407" href="#div2Ref_407">THE PROPHET JONAH.</a></h2>
<p class="normal">It has been asserted without any sufficient reason, that Jonah
is older than Hosea, Joel, Amos, and Obadiah,&mdash;that he is the oldest among the prophets
whose written monuments have been preserved to us. The passage in 2 Kings xiv. 25,
where it is said, that Jonah, the son of Amittai the prophet, prophesied to Jeroboam
the happy success of his arms, and the restoration of the ancient boundaries of
Israel, and that this prophecy was confirmed by the event, cannot decide in favour
of this assertion, because it cannot be proved that the victories of Jeroboam belonged
to the <i>beginning</i> of his reign. On the other hand, it is opposed, <i>first</i>,
by the position of the book in the collection of the Minor Prophets, which, throughout,
is chronologically arranged, and which is tantamount to an express testimony that
Jonah wrote <i>after</i> Hosea, Joel, Amos, and Obadiah. <i>Then</i>,&mdash;the circumstance
that Nineveh is mentioned here, and that too in a way which implies that, even at
that time, the hostile relations of the Assyrians to the Covenant-people had already
begun, while in the first part of Hosea, in Joel, Amos, and Obadiah, no reference
to the Assyrians is as yet found. Even ancient interpreters, as <i>Chr. B. Michaelis</i>,
<i>Crusius</i> (in the <i>Theol. Proph.</i> iii. S. 38), inferred from this mention
of Nineveh, that the book had been composed in consequence of the first invasion
of the Assyrians under Menahem, who ascended the throne 13 years after the death
of Jeroboam II. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;the book begins with <i>and</i>. Wherever else,
in the canonical books of the Old Testament, such a beginning occurs, it indicates
a resumption of, and a junction with, former links in the chain of sacred literature;
compare Judges i. 1; 1 Sam. i. 1; Ezek. i. 1. That the expression, &quot;And it came
to pass,&quot; with which the book opens, is intended to establish the connection with
the prophecy of Obadiah, which occupies the immediately preceding place in the Canon,
is intimated by the internal relation of the two books to each other. The prophecy
of Obadiah bears, throughout, a hostile aspect to the heathen world; it appears
to him as the object only of God&#39;s judging activity. Jonah, on the other hand, received
the mission, distinctly to point out the other aspect of the matter, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span> thereby, not indeed to correct, but certainly
to supplement his predecessor.</p>
<p class="normal">The time was approaching when the heathen world was to pour out
its floods upon the people of God. It was obvious that the position of Israel towards
it became one altogether repulsive, that the susceptibility of the heathen for salvation
was denied, and God&#39;s mercy was limited to Israel. Narrow-minded exclusiveness received
a powerful support from the oppression and haughtiness of the heathen. Whilst other
prophets opposed such exclusiveness by their words, by announcing the extension
of salvation to the Gentiles, Jonah received the mission to illustrate, by a symbolical
action, the capacity of the heathen for salvation, and their future participation
in it. The effect of this must necessarily have been so much the greater, as the
whole of the little book is exclusively devoted to this subject, as it appeared
at the first beginning of the conflict, and as Nineveh is mentioned here, for the
first time, in so peaceable and conciliatory a relation, and in close harmony and
connection with the announcement of the willing submission of the heathen world
to the dominion of Shiloh, spoken of in Gen. xlix. 10. It is remarkably impressive
to see how spirit here triumphs over nature&mdash;a triumph which appears so much the
brighter because the prophet himself pays his tribute to nature; for it was because
he listened to the voice of nature, that, at first, he intended to flee to Tarshish.
The reason why the commission of the Lord was so disagreeable to him, we learn from
chap. iv. 2. He was afraid lest the preaching of repentance, which was committed
to him, might turn away the judgments of the Lord from Nineveh, the metropolis of
that country which threatened destruction to Israel. He knew the deep corruption
of his own people, and foreboded the issue which the extension of the means of grace
to the Gentiles might very easily bring about in the end. But yet, he felt almost
irresistibly impelled to carry out the commission of God, and in order to cut himself
off from the possibility of following the voice which called him to the east, he
resolved to go to the far distant west. The voice, however, followed him even there;
but the farther he advanced on his journey, the more difficult it became for him
to follow it. At a later period, when the Lord granted mercy to Nineveh, he was
angry and wished to die, not by any means because he <span class="pagenum">[Pg 409]</span>
felt himself injured in his honour as a prophet (as was erroneously supposed, even
by <i>Calvin</i>), but because he grudged to the Gentiles the mercy which he considered
as a prerogative of Israel only, and because he was anxious for the destruction
of Nineveh as the metropolis of that kingdom which was destined to be the rod of
chastisement for his own people. He was thus actuated by the same ardent love for
his people which called forth the wish of St Paul, that he might become an anathema
for his brethren,&mdash;by the same disposition of mind which prevailed in the elder brother
at the return of the prodigal son (Luke xv. 25 ff.), and which at first would manifest
itself even in Peter, Acts x. 14 ff. The Jewish sentence (<i>Carpzov. Introd.</i>
3, p. 149), &quot;Jonah was anxious for the glory of the Son, but he did not seek the
glory of the Father,&quot; is very significant. Jonah exhibits, in a very striking way,
the thoughts of his old man, in order that Israel might recognise themselves in
his image. But we are not at liberty to say that the prophet represented the people
only. It is true that, as one of the people, he also entertained those thoughts;
but, besides these, he entertained other thoughts also. The voices of the Lord which
he heard were spiritual; and such voices can be heard only when there is something
akin in the heart. Not even with one step did Jonah touch the territory of the false
prophets, who prophesied out of their own hearts. He retained all his human weakness
to himself, and the Word of God stood by the side of it in unclouded brightness,
and obtained absolute victory.</p>
<p class="normal">There can be no doubt that we have before us in the Book of Jonah
the description of a symbolical action,&mdash;that his mission to Nineveh has an object
distinct from the mission itself,&mdash;that it is not the result attained by it in the
first instance which is the essential point, but that it is its aim to bring to
light certain truths, and in the form of fact, to prophesy future things. The truths
are these:&mdash;<i>First</i>, that the Gentiles are by no means so unsusceptible of the
higher truth as vulgar prejudice imagined them to be. This was manifested by the
conduct of the sailors, who, at last, offer sacrifices and even vows to Jehovah;
but, in a more striking manner, by the deep impression which the discourse of Jonah
produced upon the Ninevites. In this we have the actual proof of Ezek. iii. 5, 6,
where the prophet represents his mission as one of peculiar difficulty&mdash;more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 410]</span> difficult, even, than it would have been if
addressed to the Gentiles: &quot;Had I sent thee to them, surely they would have hearkened
to thee.&quot; <i>Further</i>,&mdash;that it is not in His relation to Israel only, but in
His relation to the Gentiles also, that the Lord is &quot;gracious and merciful, slow
to anger and of great kindness,&quot; chap. iv. 2. The view which these words, at once,
open up into the future, is, that at some future period the Lord will grant to the
Gentiles the preaching of His word, and admission into His kingdom. The glory of
His mercy and grace would have been darkened, if the revelation of them had been
for ever limited to a particular, small portion of the human race. Nineveh, the
representative of the heathen multitude, is very significantly called the &quot;great
city&quot; at the very outset, in i. 2, and &quot;a great city for God,&quot; in iii. 3, for which,
as <i>Michaelis</i> remarks, God specially cared, on account of the great number
of souls; compare iv. 11.</p>
<p class="normal">If the symbolical and prophetical character of the book be denied,
the fact of its having its place among the prophetical, and not among the historical,
books, admits of no explanation at all. For so much is evident, that this fact cannot
be satisfactorily accounted for by the circumstance that the book reports the events
which happened to a prophet. The sound explanation has been already given by <i>
Marckius</i>: &quot;The book is, in a great measure, historical, but in such a manner,
that in the history itself there is hidden the mystery of the greatest prophecy,
and that Jonah proves himself to be a true prophet, by the events which happened
to him, not less than by his utterances.&quot; A similar explanation is given by <i>Carpzovius</i>:
&quot;By his own example, as well as by the event itself, he bore witness that it was
the will of God that all men should be saved, and should come to the knowledge of
the truth,&quot; 1 Tim. ii. 4.</p>
<p class="normal">We are led to the same conclusion by the representation itself.
This differs very widely from that given in the historical books. The objection
raised by <i>Hitzig</i> against the historical truth,&mdash;viz., that the narrative is
fragmentary,&mdash;that it wants completeness,&mdash;that a number of events are communicated
only in so far as is required by the object of gaining a foundation for the graphic
representation of the doctrinal contents,&mdash;cannot be set aside so easily as is done
by <i>Hävernich</i> when he says: <span class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</span> &quot;By arguments
of a nature so flimsy, suspicions may be raised against the truth of every historical
report.&quot; We cannot but confess that, to the writer, history is indeed a means only
of representing a thought to which he is anxious to give currency in the Church
of God. It is just for this reason that he abstains from graphically enlarging,
because that would have been an obstacle to his purpose. The narrative of a symbolical
action which took place outwardly, comes, in this respect, under the same law as
the narrative of a symbolical action belonging to the internal territory, and to
that of the parable. The narrative would lose the character of perspicuity which
is so necessary for the whole matter, if it were complete in the subordinate circumstances.</p>
<p class="normal">It also tells in favour of the symbolical character of the history
of Jonah, that the missionary activity on behalf of the Gentiles does not properly
belong to the vocation of the prophets, their mission being to the two houses of
Israel only. In the entire history, not even a single example is to be found of
a prophet who, for the good of the heathen world itself, went out among them. The
history of Elisha, in 2 Kings viii. 7 ff., has, without sufficient reason, been
adduced by <i>Hävernick</i>. According to the visions of the prophets themselves,
the conversion of the heathen is not to be accomplished <i>at present</i>, but in
the Messianic time, and by the Messiah Himself. If, then, the book itself is not
to stand altogether isolated, the symbolical character of Jonah&#39;s mission must be
acknowledged. But then it is only in the form that it differs from the announcements
of the extension of salvation to the heathen also,&mdash;announcements which occur in
the other prophets also. That which these exhibited in words merely, is here made
conspicuous by deeds. The influence thereby produced upon the heathen appears then
only as the means, while the real purpose is to make an important truth familiar
to the Congregation of God, and, by a striking fact, to remove the prejudices which
prevailed in it.</p>
<p class="normal"><i>Finally</i>,&mdash;If the symbolical character of the facts be denied,
the mission of Jonah appears to be almost divested of every aim; for the good emotions
of the crew, and the repentance of the Ninevites, evidently did not lead to any
lasting result. If anything else were aimed at than the prefiguring of future events,
the prophet might better have stayed at home; an unassuming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</span> ministry in some corner among the Covenant-people
would have carried along with it a greater reward.</p>
<p class="normal">If, on the other hand, the symbolical character of the history
of Jonah be admitted, remarkable parallels in the history of Jesus present themselves.
The Saviour, in the days of His flesh, was satisfied with the prophetic intimation
of the future farther extension of His salvation. That which He Himself did for
this extension, in those particular cases where the faith of non-Israelites obtruded
itself upon Him, must, in its isolation, be viewed as an embodiment of that intimation,&mdash;as
a prophecy by deeds. He says in Matt. xv. 24: &quot;I am not sent but to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel;&quot; but if, nevertheless. He purposely makes His abode in the
territory of Tyre and Sidon; if there He hears the prayer of the Canaanitish woman
to heal her daughter, after having first tried her faith, then His purpose evidently
is: That His prophecy in words concerning the extension of salvation to the Gentiles,
might find a support in His prophecy in deeds. Jesus, prefiguring the future doings
of His servants, passed over the boundaries of the Gentiles. Whilst the Jews had
rejected the salvation offered to them, and forced Jesus to retire into concealment,
the heathen woman comes full of faith, and seeks Him in His concealment. The Canaanitish
woman is a representative of the heathen world, the future faith of which she was
called to prefigure by sustaining the trial. From her example, the Apostles were
to learn what might be expected from the Gentiles when the time should arrive for
proclaiming the Gospel to them also. In Matt. x. 5, 6, the Lord speaks to the Apostles:
&quot;Go not in the way of the Gentiles, and into any of the cities of the <i>Samaritans</i>
enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&quot; His own conduct,
however, as it is reported in John iv., stands in contradiction to this command
to His Apostles, so long as its prophetical significance is not acknowledged. That
which was, on a large scale, to be done by Christ in the state of glorification,
was prefigured by Him, on a smaller scale, in the state of humiliation. The ministry
of Christ in Samaria bears the same relation to the later mission among this people,
that the single instances of Christ&#39;s raising the dead do to the general resurrection.
The Lord afterwards did not foster the germs which had come forth among the Samaritans;
He, in the meantime, left them altogether <span class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</span>
to their fate. That prelude was quite sufficient for the object which He then had
in view, and nothing further could be done without violating the rights of the Covenant-people,
to which, in the conversation as recorded by John, the Lord as expressly pays attention,
as He does in Matt. x.</p>

<h2><span class="sc"><a name="div2_413" href="#div2Ref_413">THE PROPHET MICAH.</a></span></h2>
<h3><a name="div3_413" href="#div3Ref_413">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">Micah signifies: &quot;Who is like Jehovah;&quot; and by this name, the
prophet is consecrated to the incomparable God, just as Hosea was to the helping
God, and Nahum to the comforting God. He prophesied, according to the inscription,
under Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. We are not, however, entitled, on this account,
to dissever his prophecies, and to assign particular discourses to the reign of
each of these kings. On the contrary, the entire collection forms only one whole.
At the termination of his prophetic ministry, under Hezekiah, the prophet committed
to writing everything which was of importance for all coming time that had been
revealed to him during the whole duration of that ministry. He collected into one
comprehensive picture all the detached visions which had been granted to him in
manifold repetition; giving us the sum and substance (of which nothing has been
lost in the case of any of the men inspired by God) of what was spoken at different
times, and omitting all which was accidental, and purely local and temporary.</p>
<p class="normal">This view, which alone is the correct one, and which contributes
so largely to the right understanding of the prophet, has been already advanced
by several of the older scholars. Thus <i>Lightfoot</i> (<i>Ordo temporum</i>, opp.
i. p. 99) remarks: &quot;It is easier to conceive that the matter of this whole book
represents the substance of the prophecy which he uttered under these various kings,
than to determine which of the chapters of this book were uttered under the particular
reign of each of these kings.&quot; <i>Majus</i> also (<i>Economia temporum</i>, p. 898)
says: &quot;He repeated, at a subsequent period, what he had spoken at different
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 414]</span> times, and under different kings.&quot; In modern
times, however, this view had been generally abandoned; and although, at present,
many critics are disposed to return to it, <i>Hitzig</i> and <i>Maurer</i> still
assert, that the book was composed at different periods.</p>
<p class="normal">We shall now endeavour to prove the unity of the book, <i>first</i>,
from the prophecies themselves. If we were entitled to separate them at all, according
to time and circumstances, we could form a division into three discourses only;
viz., chap. i. and ii.; chap. iii.-v.; and chap. vi. and vii. For, 1. Each of these
discourses forms a whole, complete in itself, and in which the various elements
of the prophetic discourse&mdash;reproof, threatening, promise&mdash;are repeated. If these
discourses be torn asunder, we get only the <i>lacera membra</i> of a prophetic
discourse. 2. Each of these three discourses, forming an harmonious whole, begins
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;</span>, <i>hear</i>. That this is not merely
accidental, appears from the beginning of the first discourse,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493; &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1500;&#1501;</span>, &quot;Hear, all ye people.&quot; These
words literally agree with those which were uttered by the prophet&#39;s elder namesake,
when, according to 1 Kings xxii. 28, he called upon the whole world to attend to
the remarkable struggle betwixt the true and false prophets. It is evidently on
purpose that the prophet begins with the same words as those with which the elder
Micah had closed his discourse to Ahab, and, it may be, his whole prophetic ministry.
By this very circumstance he gives intimation of what may be expected from him,
shows that his activity is to be considered as a continuation of that of his predecessor,
who was so jealous for God, and that he had more in common with him than the mere
name. <i>Rosenmüller</i> (<i>Prol. ad Mich.</i> p. 8) has asserted, indeed, that
these words are only put into the mouth of the elder Micah, and that they are taken
from the passage under consideration. But the reason which he adduces in support
of this assertion, viz., that it cannot be conceived how it could ever have entered
the mind of that elder Micah to call upon all people to be witnesses of an announcement
which concerned Ahab only, needs no detailed refutation. Why then is it that in
Deut. xxxii. 1, Is. i. 2, heaven and earth are called upon to be witnesses of an
announcement which concerned the Jewish people only? Who does not see that, to the
prophet, Israel appears as too small an audience <span class="pagenum">[Pg 415]</span>
for the announcement of the great decision which he has just uttered; in the same
manner as the Psalmist (compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Ps. xcvi. 3) exhorts to proclaim to
the Gentiles the great deeds of the Lord, because Palestine is too narrow for them?&mdash;But
now, if it be established that it was with a distinct object that the prophet employed
the words, &quot;Hear ye,&quot; does not the circumstance that they are found at the commencement
of the three discourses, which are complete in themselves, afford sufficient ground
for the assumption, that it was the intention of the prophet, not indeed absolutely
to limit them to the beginning of a new discourse (compare, on the contrary, iii.
9<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_415a" href="#ftn_415a">[1]</a></sup>), but
yet, not to commence a new discourse without them; so that the want of them is decisive
against the supposition of a new section? 3. As soon as an attempt is made to break
up any of these three discourses, many particular circumstances are at once found,
upon a careful examination, to prove a connection of the sections so close, as not
to admit of a separation without mutilating them. Thus chap. i. and ii. cannot be
separated from each other, for the reason that the promise in ii. 12, 13, refers
to the threatening in i. 5. That promise refers to all Israel, just as does the
threatening in chap. i.; whilst in the threatening and reproof in chap. ii. the
eye of the prophet is directed only to the main object of his ministry, viz., to
Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">But even these three divisions, which hitherto we have proved
to be the only divisions that do exist,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_415b" href="#ftn_415b">[2]</a></sup>
can be considered as such, in so far only as in them the discourse takes a fresh
start, and enters upon a new sphere. They cannot be considered as complete in themselves,
and separated from one another by the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</span> difference
of the periods of their composition; for even in them there are found traces of
a close connection. Even the uniform beginning by &quot;Hear&quot; may be considered as such.
The second discourse in iii. 1 begins with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</span>;
but the <i>Fut.</i> with <i>Vav convers.</i> always, and without exception, connects
a new action with a preceding one, and can never be used where there is an absolutely
new commencement. Its significance here, where it is used in the transition from
the promise to a new reproof and threatening, has been very strikingly brought out
thus, by <i>Ch. Bened. Michaelis</i>: &quot;But while we are yet but too far away from
those longed-for times, which have just been promised, I <i>say</i> in the meanwhile,
viz., in order to complete the list of the iniquities of evil princes and teachers,
begun in chap. ii.&quot; The words of iii. 1, &quot;Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and
ye princes of the house of Israel,&quot; have an evident reference to ii. 12: &quot;I will
assemble Jacob all of thee, I will gather the remnant of Israel.&quot; In the new threatening,
the prophet chooses quite the same designation as in the preceding promise, in order
to prevent the latter from giving support to false security. It is not by any means
Samaria alone, but all Israel, which is the object of divine punishment. It is only
a remnant of Israel that shall be gathered. But the reference to the preceding discourse
is still more obvious in ver. 4: &quot;Then they shall cry unto the Lord, and He will
not answer; and may He hide<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_416a" href="#ftn_416a">[3]</a></sup>
His face from them at this time, as they have behaved themselves ill towards Him
in their doings.&quot; Now, as in vers. 1-3 divine judgments had not yet been spoken
of, the terms &quot;then,&quot; and &quot;at this time,&quot; can refer only to the threatenings of
punishment in ii. 3 ff., which have a special reference to the ungodly nobles.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus the result presented at the beginning, is confirmed to us
by internal reasons. The inscription<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_416b" href="#ftn_416b">[4]</a></sup>
announces the oracles <span class="pagenum">[Pg 417]</span> of God which came to
Micah under the reign of three kings; while the examination of the contents proves
that the collection forms a connected whole, written <i>uno tenore</i>. How, now,
can these two facts be reconciled in any other way than by supposing that we have
here before us a comprehensive picture of the prophetic ministry of Micah, the single
component parts of which are at once contemporaneous, and yet belonging to different
periods? This supposition, moreover, affords us the advantage of being allowed to
maintain all the historical references in their fullest import, without being led
to disregard the one, while we give attention to the other; for nothing is, in this
case, more natural, than that the prophet connects with one another different prophecies
uttered at different times.</p>
<p class="normal">The weight of these internal reasons is increased, however, by
external reasons which are equally strong. When Jeremiah was called to account for
his prophecy concerning the destruction of the city, the elders, for his justification,
appealed to the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 418]</span> entirely similar prophecy
of Micah in iii. 12: &quot;Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field,
and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house as the
high places of the forest.&quot; In Jer. xxvi. 18, 19, it is said, &quot;Micah prophesied
in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, etc.
Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah, put him to death? Did he not fear the
Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord repented Him of the evil which He had
pronounced against them?&quot; All interpreters admit that this passage forms an authority
for the composition of the discourse in iii.-v. under Hezekiah; but we cannot well
limit it in this way, we must extend it to the whole collection. For, even apart
from the reasons by which we proved that the entire book forms one closely connected
whole, it is most improbable that the elders should have known, by an oral tradition,
the exact time of the composition of one single discourse, which has no special
date at the head of it. Is it not a far more natural supposition, that they considered
the collection as a whole, of which the component parts had, indeed, been delivered
by the prophet at a former period, but had been repeated, and united into one description
under Hezekiah; and that they mentioned Hezekiah, partly because it could not be
determined with certainty whether this special prediction had already been uttered
under one of his predecessors, and, if so, under which of them; and partly, because
among the three kings mentioned in the inscription, Hezekiah alone formed an ecclesiastical
authority?</p>
<p class="normal">But just as that quotation in Jeremiah furnishes us with a proof
that all the prophecies of Micah, which have been preserved to us, were committed
to writing under Hezekiah, so we can, in a similar manner, prove from Isaiah, chap.
ii., that they were, at least in part, uttered at a previous period. The problem
of the relation of Is. ii. 2-4 to Micah iv. 1-3, cannot be solved in any other way
than by supposing, that this portion of a prophecy which, in Jeremiah, is assigned
to the reign of Hezekiah, was uttered by Micah as early as under the reign of Jotham,
and that soon after it Isaiah, by placing the words of Micah at the head of his
own prophecies, expressed that which had come to him also in inward vision; for,
being already known to the people, they could not fail to produce their impression.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span> Every other solution can be proved to be untenable.
1. Least of all is there any refutation needed of the hypothesis which is now generally
abandoned, viz., that the passage in Isaiah is the original one; compare, against
this hypothesis, <i>Kleinert</i>, <i>Aechtheit des Jes.</i> S. 356; <i>Caspari</i>,
S. 444. 2. Equally objectionable is another supposition, that both the prophets
had made use of some older prophecy&mdash;one uttered by Joel, as <i>Hitzig</i> and <i>
Ewald</i> have maintained. The connection in which these verses stand in Micah,
is by far too close for such a supposition. We could not, indeed, so confidently
advance this argument, if the connection consisted only in what is commonly brought
forward, viz., that upon the monitory announcement of punishment in chap. iii.,
there follows, in chap. iv. 1 ff., the <i>consolatory</i> promise of a glorious
future for the godly, and that the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;</span> in ver.
1 evidently connects it with what immediately precedes. But the reference and connection
are far more close. The promise in iv. 1, 2, is, throughout, contrasted with the
threatening in iii. 12. &quot;The mountain of the house shall become as the high places
of the forest,&quot;&mdash;hence, despised, solitary, and desolate. In iv. 1, there is opposed
to it, &quot;The mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established on the top of
the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and upon it people shall
flee together.&quot; &quot;Zion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem become a heap
of ruins.&quot; Contrasted with this, there is in iv. 2 the declaration: &quot;For the law
shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord of Jerusalem.&quot; The desolate and
despised place now becomes the residence of the Lord, from which He sends His commands
over the whole earth, and of which the brilliant centre now is Jerusalem. In order
to make this contrast so much the more obvious, the prophet begins, in the promise,
with just the mountain of the temple, which, in the threatening, had occupied the
last place; so that the opposites are brought into immediate connection. Nor is
it certainly merely accidental that, in the threatening, he speaks of the mountain
of the house only, while, in the promise, he speaks of the mountain of the house
of the Lord; compare Matt. xxiii. 38, where &quot;your house,&quot; according to <i>Bengel</i>,
&quot;is the house which, in other passages, is called the house of the Lord,&quot; just as
the Lord, in Exod. xxxii. 7, says to Moses, &quot;<i>Thy people.</i>&quot; The temple must
have ceased to be the house of the Lord, before it would be destroyed; for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 420]</span> which reason, as we are told In Ezekiel, the
Shechinah removed from it before the Babylonish destruction. And in point of form,
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;</span> in iv. 1 so much the more corresponds
with the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;</span> in iii. 12, as from the latter
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;</span> must be supplied for the last clause
of the verse; compare <i>Caspari</i>, S. 445. That ver. 5 must not be separated
from the prophecy which Isaiah had before him, is seen from a comparison of Is.
ii. 5: &quot;O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord.&quot; According
to the true interpretation, &quot;the light of the Lord&quot; signifies His grace, and the
blessings which, according to what precedes, are to be bestowed by it; and &quot;to walk
in the light of the Lord,&quot; means to participate in the enjoyment of grace. These
words, accordingly, are closely related to those in Mic. iv. 5: &quot;For all the people
shall walk, every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the
Lord our God for ever and ever:&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, the fate of the people in the heathen
world corresponds to the nature of their gods; because these are nothing, they too
shall sink down into nothingness, while Israel shall partake in the glory of his
God. There is the same thought, and in essentially the same dress, both in Isaiah
and Micah,&mdash;only that the words which in Micah embody a pure promise, are transformed
by Isaiah into an exhortation that Israel should not, by their own fault, forfeit
this preference over the heathen nations, that they should not wantonly wander away
into dark solitudes, from the path of light which the Lord had opened up before
them. This transformation in Isaiah, however, may be accounted for by the consideration,
that he was anxious to prepare the way for the reproofs which now follow from ver.
6; whilst Micah, who had already premised them, could continue in the promise. It
is also in favour of the originality of the passage in Micah, that the text which,
in Isaiah, appears as a variation, appears as original in Micah; so that both cannot
be equally dependent upon a third writer. 3. There now remains only the view of
<i>Kleinert</i>, according to which the prophecy of Micah, in chap. iii.-v., was
first uttered under the reign of Hezekiah; and, under the reign of the same king,
but somewhat later, the prophecy, in chap. ii.-iv. of Isaiah, who avails himself
of it. But, upon a closer examination, this view also proves untenable. Isaiah&#39;s
description of the condition of the people in a moral point of view, the general
spread of idolatry <span class="pagenum">[Pg 421]</span> and vice, exclude every
other period in the reign of Hezekiah except the first beginning of it, when the
effect and influence of the time of Ahaz were still felt; so that even <i>Kleinert</i>
(p. 364) is obliged to assume, that not only the prophecy of Micah, but also that
of Isaiah, were uttered in the first months of the reign of this king. But other
difficulties&mdash;and these altogether insuperable&mdash;stand in the way of this assumption.
In the whole section of Isaiah, the nation appears as rich, flourishing, and powerful.
This is most strongly expressed in chap. ii. 7: &quot;His land is full of silver and
gold, there is no end to his treasure; his land is full of horses, and there is
no end to his chariots.&quot; To this may be added the description of the consequences
of wealth, and of the unbounded luxury, in iii. 16 ff.; and the threatening of the
withdrawal of all power, and all riches, as a strong contrast with their present
condition, upon which they, in their blindness, rested the hope of their security,
and hence imagined that they stood in no need of the assistance of the Lord, iii.
1 ff. Now this description is so inapplicable to the commencement of Hezekiah&#39;s
reign, that the very opposite of it should rather be expected. The invasion by the
allied Syrians and Israelites, the oppression by the Assyrians, and the tribute
which they had to pay to them, the internal administration, which was bad beyond
example, and the curse of God resting on all their enterprises and efforts, had
exhausted, during the reign of the ungodly Ahaz, the treasures which had been collected
under Uzziah and Jotham, and had dried up the sources of prosperity. He had left
the kingdom to his successors in a condition of utter decay. To these, other reasons
still may be added, which are in favour of the composition of it under Jotham, while
they are against its composition under Hezekiah; especially the circumstance of
their standing at the beginning of the collection of the first twelve chapters (a
circumstance which is of great weight, inasmuch as these chapters are, beyond any
doubt, arranged chronologically), but still more, the indefiniteness and generality
in the threatening of the divine judgments, which the prophecy of Micah has in common
with the nearly contemporaneous chapters i. and v. of Isaiah, whilst the threatenings
out of the first period of the reign of Ahaz have at once a far more definite character.
By these considerations we are involuntarily led back to a period when Isaiah still
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 422]</span> pre-eminently exercised the office of exhorting
and reproving, and had not yet been favoured with special revelations concerning
the events of a future which, at that time, was as yet rather distant,&mdash;perhaps as
far as the time when Jotham administered the government for his father, who was
at that time still alive; compare 2 Kings xv. 5. By this hypothesis. Is. iii. 12
is more satisfactorily explained than by any other; and we are no longer under the
necessity of asserting, that the chronological order is interrupted by chap. vi.;
for this certainly could not have been intended by the collector. The solemn call
and consecration of the prophet to his office, accompanied by an increased bestowal
of grace, must be carefully distinguished from the ordinary ones which were common
to him with all the other prophets. But if the prophecy of Isaiah was uttered as
early as under Jotham (which has lately been most satisfactorily proved by <i>Caspari</i>
in his <i>Beiträge zur Einl. in das Buch Jesaias</i>, S. 234 ff.), that of Micah
also must have existed at that time, and must have been in the mouths of the people.
And since its composition is assigned to the reign of Hezekiah, it follows that
the prophet delivered anew, under the reign of this king, the revelations which
he had already received at an earlier period.</p>
<p class="normal">It will not be possible to infer with certainty from vers. 6,
7, as <i>Caspari</i> does, that the book was committed to writing before the destruction
of Samaria, and hence, before the sixth year of Hezekiah. Since the book gives the
sum and substance of what was prophesied under three kings, all that is implied
in vers. 6, 7, is, that the destruction of Samaria was foretold by Micah; but the
prophecy itself may have been committed to writing even after the fulfilment had
taken place. But, on the other hand, according to the analogy of Is. xxxix., and
xiii. and xiv., we are led by iv. 9, 10, to the time of Sennacherib&#39;s invasion of
Judea, in which the prophetic spirit of Isaiah likewise most richly displayed itself,
and in which he was privileged with a glance into the far distant future.</p>
<p class="normal">The exordium in chap. i. and ii., and the close in vi. and vii.,
are distinguished by the generality of the threatening and promise which prevails
in them. They have this in common with the first five chapters of Isaiah, and thus
certainly afford us pre-eminently an image of the prophetic ministry of Micah, in
the time previous to the Assyrian invasion; whilst the main
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</span> body (especially from iv. 8) represents to
us particularly the character of the prophecy during the Assyrian period.</p>
<p class="normal">We shall now attempt to give a survey of the contents of Micah&#39;s
prophecy.</p>
<p class="normal">Upon Samaria and Jerusalem&mdash;the kingdom of the ten tribes, and
Judah&mdash;a judgment by foreign enemies is to come. Total destruction, and the carrying
away of the inhabitants, will be the issue of this judgment, and, as regards Judah
more particularly, the total overthrow of the dominion of the Davidic dynasty.</p>
<p class="normal">Samaria is first visited by this judgment. This is indicated by
the fact that it is first mentioned in the inscription, and that in i. 6, 7, the
judgment upon Samaria is, first of all, described; but especially by the circumstance
that Samaria, in i. 5, appears as the chief seat of corruption for the whole people,
whence it flowed upon Judah also, i. 14, and particularly, vi. 16. We expect that
where the carcases first were, there the eagles would first be gathered together.</p>
<p class="normal">As the first, and principal instrument of the destructive judgment
upon Judah, Babylon is mentioned in iv. 10.</p>
<p class="normal">As the representative of the world&#39;s power, at the time then present,
Asshur appears in v. 4, 5. If destruction is to fall upon the kingdom of the ten
tribes <i>before</i> it falls upon Judah&mdash;which is most distinctly foretold by Hosea
in i. 4-7&mdash;then, nothing was more obvious than to think of Asshur as the instrument
of the judgment. That to which Micah, on this point, only alludes, is more fully
expanded by Isaiah.</p>
<p class="normal">Judah is delivered from Babylon, but without a restoration of
the kingdom, iv. 10, compared with ver. 14 (v. 1).</p>
<p class="normal">But a second catastrophe comes upon Judah, inasmuch as many heathens
gather themselves against Jerusalem, with the intention of desecrating it, but yet
in such a manner that, by the assistance of the Lord, it comes forth victoriously
from this severe attack, chap. iv. 11-13. Then follows a third catastrophe, in which
Judah becomes anew and totally subject to the world&#39;s power, iv. 14 (v. 1).</p>
<p class="normal">From the deepest abasement, however, the Congregation of the Lord
rises to the highest glory, inasmuch as the dominion returns to the old Davidic
race, iv. 8. From the little Bethlehem, the native place of David, where his race,
sunk back again into <span class="pagenum">[Pg 424]</span> the lowliness of private
life, has resumed its seat, a new and glorious Ruler proceeds, born, and at the
same time eternal, and clothed with the fulness of the glory of the Lord, v. 1,
3 (2, 4), by whom Jacob obtains truth, and Abraham mercy, vii. 20, compared with
John i. 17; by whom the Congregation is placed in the centre of the world, and becomes
the object of the longing of all nations, iv. 1-3, delivered from the servitude
of the world, and conquering the world, v. 4, 5 (5, 6), vii. 11, 12; and at the
same time lowly, and inspiring the nations with fear, v. 6-8 (7-9). To such a height,
however, she shall attain after, by means of the judgment preceding the mercy, all
that has been taken from her upon which she in the present founded the hope of her
salvation, v. 9-14 (10-15).</p>

	or the exordium and principal part, are brought into a still closer connection,&mdash;a
	connection founded upon the circumstance that the reproof and threatening of
	the first part are to be here resumed, in order that thus a comprehensive representation
	may be given. It is only in iii. 12 that the threatening reaches its height.
	But yet the tripartition remains the prominent one. This cannot be denied without

	<sup class="ftnRef">[3]</sup></a> The <i>Fut. apoc.</i> forbids us to translate:
	&quot;He will hide.&quot; In order to express his own delight in the doings of divine

	in Is. ii. 9, where the greater number of interpreters assume, in opposition
	to the rules of grammar, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;</span> stands

<div class="ftnlast">

	<sup class="ftnRef">[4]</sup></a> Against the genuineness of the inscription,
	doubts have been raised by many, after the example of <i>Hartmann</i>, and last
	of all by <i>Ewald</i> and <i>Hitzig</i>; but it is established by the striking
	allusions to, and coincidences with it, in the text. With the mention of Micah&#39;s
	name in the former, the allusion to this name in the <i>close</i> of the book,
	in chap. vii. 18, corresponds. The circumstance of Micah being called the Morasthite,
	accounts for the fact that, in this threatening against the cities of Judah,
	in i. 14, it is Moresheth alone which is mentioned. In the inscription, Samaria
	and Jerusalem are pointed out as the objects of the prophet&#39;s predictions; and
	it is in harmony with this, that in i. 6, 7, the judgment upon Samaria is first
	described, and then the judgment upon Judah; that the prophet&mdash;although, indeed,
	he has Judah chiefly in view&mdash;frequently gives attention to the ten tribes also,
	and includes them,&mdash;as in the promise in ii. 12, 13, v. 1 (2), where the Messiah
	appears as the Ruler in Israel, and vers. 6, 7 (7, 8), of the same chapter;
	and that in iii. 8, 9, Judah is represented as a particular part only of the
	great whole. <i>Finally</i>&mdash;It is peculiar to Micah, that he thus views so specially
	the two <i>capitals</i>; and this again is in harmony with the inscription,
	where just these, and not Israel and Judah, appear as the subjects of the prophecy.
	It is in the capitals that Micah beholds the concentration of the corruption
	(i. 5); and to them the threatening also is chiefly addressed, i. 6, 7, iii.
	12. Of the promise, also, Jerusalem forms the centre.&mdash;The statement, too, in
	the inscription&mdash;that Micah uttered the contents of his book under various kings&mdash;likewise
	receives a confirmation from the prophecy. The mention of the high places of
	Judah in i. 5, and of the walking in the statutes of Omri, and in all the works
	of the house of Ahab, refers especially to the time of Ahaz; compare 2 Kings
	xvi. 4; 2 Chron. xxviii. 4, 25; further, 2 Kings xvi. 3; 2 Chron. xxviii. 2;
	and <i>Caspari</i> on Micah, S. 74. On the other hand, the time of Hezekiah
	is suggested by v. 4, 6 (5, 6), which implies that already, at that time, Asshur
	had appeared as the enemy of the people of God,&mdash;and so likewise by the prophecy
	in iv. 9-14.</p>
</div>
<hr class="W20">
<h3><a name="div3_424" href="#div3Ref_424">CHAP. I. AND II.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The prophet begins with the words: &quot;<i>Hear, all ye people, hearken,
O earth and the fulness thereof, and let the Lord God be witness against you, the
Lord from His holy temple. For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of His place,
and cometh down, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains
are melted under Him, and the valleys are cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters
poured down a steep place. For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the
sins of the house of Israel.</i>&quot; Vers. 2-5.</p>
<p class="normal">This majestic exordium has been misunderstood in various ways:
<i>First</i>, by those who, like <i>Hitzig</i>, would understand by the people,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span> in ver. 2, the tribes of Israel. We shall
show, when commenting on Zech. xi. 10, that this is altogether inadmissible. But
in the present case especially, this interpretation must be rejected; partly on
account of the reference to the words of the elder Micah, and partly on account
of the parallel terms, &quot;O earth and the fulness thereof,&quot; which, according to the
constant <i>usus loquendi</i>, lead us far beyond the narrow limits of Palestine.
On the other hand, they who by the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span> rightly
understand the nations of the whole earth, are mistaken in this, that they consider
them as mere witnesses, whom the Lord calls <span class="pagenum">[Pg 425]</span>
up against His unthankful people, instead of considering them as the very same against
whom the Lord bears witness; and that they come into consideration from this point
of view, clearly appears from the words, &quot;The Lord be witness against you.&quot; As regards
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1491;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span>
following, compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Mal. iii. 5.&mdash;Another mistake is committed in the
definition of the way and manner of the divine witness. The greater number of interpreters
suppose it to be the subsequent admonitory, reproving, and threatening discourse
of the prophet. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Michaelis</i>, who explains: &quot;Do not despise
and lightly esteem such a witness, who by me earnestly and publicly testifies to
you His will.&quot; But in opposition to this view, it appears from ver. 3, that here,
as well as in Mal. iii. 5, &quot;And I will come near to you in judgment, and I am a
swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those
that swear to a lie,&quot; the witness is a real one,&mdash;that it consists in the actual
attestation of the guilt by the punishment, viz., by the divine judgment described
in vers. 3, 4. The words, &quot;The Lord cometh forth out of His place, and cometh down,&quot;
there correspond to, &quot;From His holy temple,&quot;&mdash;from which it is evident, at the same
time, that by the temple, the heavenly temple must be understood.</p>
<p class="normal">We have thus, in vers. 2-4, before us the description of a sublime
theophany, not for a partial judgment upon Judah, but for a judgment upon the whole
world, the people of which are called upon to gather around their judge&mdash;whom the
prophet beholds as already approaching, descending from His glorious habitation
in heaven, accompanied by the insignia of His power, the precursors of the judgment&mdash;and
silently to wait for His judicial and penal sentence.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_425a" href="#ftn_425a">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">But how is it to be explained that with the words, &quot;For the transgression
of Jacob is all this,&quot; etc., there is a sudden transition to the judgments upon
Israel, yea, that the prophet <span class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</span> goes on as if
Israel alone had been spoken of? Only from the relation in which these two judgments
stand to one another. For they are perfectly one in substance. They are separated
only by space, time, and unessential circumstances; so that we may say that the
general judgment appears in every partial judgment upon Israel. In order to give
expression to the thought, that it is the <i>judge of the world</i> who is to judge
Israel, the prophets not unfrequently represent the Lord appearing to judge the
whole world; and in Israel, the <i>Microcosmos</i>, it was indeed judged. We have
a perfectly analogous case, <i>e.g.</i>, in Is. chap. ii.-iv. It is only by means
of a very forced explanation, that it can be denied that after the prophet has,
by a few bold touches, from ii. 6-9, described the moral debasement of the Covenant-people,
and marked out pride as its last source, the last judgment upon the whole earth
forms the subject of discourse. In that judgment there will be a most clear revelation
of the vanity of all which is created&mdash;a vanity which, in the present course of the
world, is so frequently concealed&mdash;and that the Lord alone is exalted, and that those
who now shut their eyes will then be compelled to acknowledge these truths. That
Isaiah has this general judgment in view, is too clearly proved by the sublimity
of the whole description, by the express mention of the whole earth, <i>e.g.</i>,
ii. 19, and by not limiting, in the individualized description in ver. 12 sqq.,
the high and lofty which is to be brought low to Judah alone, but by extending it
to the whole world. But in iii. 1 ff. the prophet suddenly passes over to the typical,
penal judgment upon Judah; and the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span>, at
the commencement, shows that he does not consider this subject as one altogether
new, but as being substantially identical with the preceding subject. This reminds
us forcibly of the mode in which, in the prophecies of our Lord, the references
to the destruction of Jerusalem, and to the last judgment, are connected with one
another. In the &quot;burden of Babylon&quot; in chap. xiii. likewise, the judgment of the
Lord upon the whole earth is first described. Nor is it only on the territory of
prophecy that this close connection of the general judgment with the inferior judgments
upon the Covenant-people appears. In Ps. lxxxii. 8, <i>e.g.</i>, after the unrighteousness
prevailing among the Covenant-people has been described, the Lord is called upon
to come to judge, not them <span class="pagenum">[Pg 427]</span> alone, but the
whole earth; compare my Commentary on Ps. vii. 8, lvi. 8, lix. 6.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophet thus passes over, in ver. 5, from the general manifestation
of divine justice to its special manifestation among the Covenant-people, and mentions
here, as the most prominent points upon which it will be inflicted, Samaria and
Jerusalem, the two capitals, from which the apostasy from the Lord spread over the
rest of the country. He mentions Samaria first, and then, in vers. 6, 7, he describes
its destruction which was brought about by the Assyrians, before he makes mention
of that of Jerusalem, because the apostasy took place first in Samaria, and hence
the punishment also was hastened on. The latter circumstance, which is merely a
consequence of the former, is in an one-sided manner made prominent by the greater
number of interpreters, who therein follow the example of <i>Jerome</i>. It was
at the same time, however, probably the intention of the prophet to be done with
Samaria, in order that he might be at liberty to take up exclusively the case of
Judah and Jerusalem&mdash;the main objects of his prophetic ministry.</p>
<p class="normal">He makes the transition to this in ver. 8, by means of the words:
&quot;<i>On that account I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make
a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the ostriches.</i>&quot; &quot;<i>On that
account</i>&quot;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, on account of the judgment upon Judah, to be announced
in the subsequent verses. It is commonly supposed that the prophet here speaks in
his own person; thus, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rosenmüller</i>: &quot;The prophet mourns in a
bitter lamentation for the number and magnitude of the calamities impending over
the Israelitish people.&quot; But the correct view rather is, that the prophet, when,
in his inward vision, he sees the divine judgments not remaining and stopping at
Samaria, but poured out like a desolating torrent over Judah and Jerusalem, suddenly
sinks his own consciousness in that of his suffering people. We have thus here before
us an imperfect symbolical action, similar to that more finished one which occurs
in Is. xx. 3, 4, and which can be explained only by a deeper insight into the nature
of prophecy, according to which the dramatic character is inseparable from it. The
transition from the mere description of what is present in the inward vision only,
to the prophet&#39;s own action, is, according to this view, very easy. If we confine
ourselves to the passage before us, the following <span class="pagenum">[Pg 428]</span>
arguments are in favour of our view. 1. The predicates
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;</span>
cannot be explained upon the supposition that the prophet describes only his own
painful feelings on account of the condition of his people. Even if
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;</span> stood alone, the explanation by &quot;naked,&quot;
in the sense of &quot;deprived of the usual and decent dress, and, on the contrary, clothed
in dirt and rags,&quot; would be destitute of all proof and authority. No instance whatsoever
is found of the outward habit of a mourner being designated as nakedness. But it
is still more arbitrary thus to deal with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500;</span>,
whether it be explained by &quot;deprived of his mental faculties on account of the unbounded
grief of his soul,&quot;&mdash;as is done by several Jewish expositors (who, in the explanation
of this passage, would have done much better, had they followed the Chaldee, in
whom the correct view is found; only that he, giving up the figurative representation,
substitutes the third person for the first, paraphrasing it thus: &quot;On that account
they shall wail and howl, they shall go stripped and naked,&quot; etc.),&mdash;or by &quot;badly
clothed,&quot; as is done by the greater number of Christian expositors. The signification
&quot;robbed,&quot; &quot;plundered,&quot; is the only established one; compare
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;</span> in Job xii. 17-19. The parallel passages,
in which nakedness appears as the characteristic feature of the captives taken in
war, show how little we are entitled to depart from the most obvious signification,
in these two words. Thus we find immediately afterwards, in ver. 11: &quot;Pass ye away,
ye inhabitants of Saphir, having your shame naked;&quot; on which <i>Michaelis</i> remarks:
&quot;With naked bodies, as is the case with those who are led into captivity after having
been stripped of their clothes.&quot; Thus Is. xx. 3, 4: &quot;And the Lord said. Like as
My servant Isaiah walketh <i>naked</i> and <i>barefoot</i> three years, for a sign
and wonder upon Egypt and Ethiopia, so shall the king of Assyria lead away the prisoners
of Egypt, and the prisoners of Ethiopia, young men and old men, <i>naked</i> and
<i>barefoot</i>;&quot; compare Is. xlvii. 3.&mdash;2. The term
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1514;&#1497;</span>, in ver. 10, is in favour of the supposition,
that the prophet here appears as the representative of the future condition of his
people. The <i>Imperat. fem. </i><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1497;</span> of
the marginal reading is evidently, as is commonly the case, only the result of the
embarrassment of the Mazorets. The reading of the text can be pointed as the first
person of the Preterite only; for the view of <i>Rosenmüller</i>, who takes it as
the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 429]</span> second person of the Preterite, which
here is to have an optative signification, is, grammatically, inadmissible. <i>Rückert&#39;s</i>
explanation, &quot;In the house of <i>dust</i> (<i>zu Staubheim</i>), I have strewed
dust upon me,&quot; is quite correct. But if <i>here</i> we must suppose that the prophet
suddenly passes over from the address to his unfortunate people, to himself as their
representative, why should not this supposition be the natural one in ver. 8 also?</p>
<p class="normal">The correctness of the view which we have given is further strengthened,
if we compare the similar lamentations of the prophets in other passages, in all
of which the same results will be found. In Jer. xlviii. 31, <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Therefore
will I howl over Moab, and cry out over all Moab, over the men of Kir-heres shall
<i>he</i> groan,&quot; the &quot;he&quot; in the last clause sufficiently shows how the &quot;I&quot; in
the two preceding clauses, is to be understood,&mdash;especially if Is. xvi. 7, &quot;Therefore
Moab howleth over Moab,&quot; be compared. But if this interpretation be correct in Jeremiah,
it must certainly be correct in Is. xv. 5 also: &quot;My heart crieth out over Moab,&quot;&mdash;a
passage which Jeremiah had in view; and this so much the more, that in Is. xvi.
9-11&mdash;where a similar lamentation for Moab occurs: &quot;Therefore do I bewail as for
Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh....
Therefore my bowels sound like a harp for Moab, mine inward parts for Kirhareseth&quot;&mdash;it
is quite unsuitable to think of a lamentation of the prophet, which is expressive
of his own grief. This was seen by the Chaldee, who renders &quot;<i>my</i> bowels&quot; by
&quot;bowels of the Moabites,&quot;&mdash;a view the correctness of which has been strikingly demonstrated
by <i>Vitringa</i>: &quot;Although,&quot; he says, &quot;the emotion of compassion be by no means
unsuitable in the prophet, yet no one will be readily convinced that the prophet
was so much concerned for the vines of Sibmah and Jazer, and for the crops of the
summer-fruits of a nation hostile and opposed to the people of God, that it should
have been for him a cause for lamentation and wailing.&quot; In Is. xxi., in the prophecy
against Babylon, and in the lamentation in vers. 3, 4, &quot;Therefore are my loins filled
with pain, pangs take hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth, etc.,
the night of my pleasure has been turned into terror,&quot; it is clearly shown in what
sense such lamentations are to be understood. By &quot;the night of pleasure,&quot; we can,
especially by a comparison of Jeremiah, understand only the night of the capture
of Babylon, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</span> in which the whole city was given
up to drunkenness and riot. But it is impossible that the prophet should say that
this night&mdash;the precursor of the long-desired day for Israel&mdash;had been turned for
him into terror. Either the whole lamentation is without any meaning, or the prophet
speaks in the name of Babylon, and that, not of the Babylon of the present, but
of the Babylon of the future. This must be granted, even by those who assert that
this portion was composed at a later period; so that, even from this quarter, the
soundness of our view cannot be assailed.</p>
<p class="normal">In ver. 9, the prophet returns to quiet description, from the
symbolical action to which he had been carried away by his emotions. The subject
of this description he states in the words: &quot;<i>It cometh unto Judah; it cometh
unto the gate of my people, unto Jerusalem.</i>&quot; By individualizing, he endeavours
to give a lively view of the thought, and to impress it. He begins with an allusion
to the lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan in 2 Sam. i. 17 ff., which is
so much the more significant, that in this impending catastrophe, Israel also was
to lose his king (compare iv. 9), and that in it David was to experience the fate
of Saul. He then indicates the stations by which the hostile army advances towards
Jerusalem, and describes how, from thence, it spreads over the whole country, even
to its southern boundary, and carries away the inhabitants into exile. But, in doing
so, he always chooses places, whose names might, in some way, be brought into connection
with what they were now suffering; so that the whole passage forms a chain of <i>
paronomasias</i>. These, however, are not by any means idle plays. They have, throughout,
a practical design. The threatening is thereby to be, as it were, localized. The
thought of a divine judgment could not but be called forth in every one who should
think of one of the places mentioned. Jerusalem is first spoken of in ver. 9 as
the centre of the life of Judah: &quot;The gate of my people,&quot; etc., being tantamount
to &quot;<i>the</i> city or metropolis of it.&quot; Then, it appears a second time in ver.
12, in the middle between five Judean places preceding and five following it,&mdash;the
number ten, which is the symbolical signification of completeness, indicating that
the judgment is to be altogether comprehensive. The five places mentioned after
Jerusalem are all of them situated to the south of it. That the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 431]</span> five places, the mention of which precedes
that of Jerusalem, are all to be sought to the north of it, and that, hence, the
judgment advances from the north in geographical order, as is the case in Is. x.
28 ff. also, is evident from the fact that Beth-Leaphrah, which is identical with
Ophrah, is situated in the territory of Benjamin, and that Beth-Haezel, which is
identical with Azal in Zech. xiv. 5, was situated in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.
Hence, we cannot suppose that Zaanan here is identical with Zenan, which is situated
in the south of Jerusalem, Josh. xv. 37, nor Saphir with Samir.</p>
<p class="normal">The question still arises, In what event did the threatening of
punishment, contained in chap. i., find its fulfilment? <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>Cyril</i>,
<i>Tarnovius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Jahn</i>, and others, refer it to the Assyrian
invasion. <i>Jerome</i> referred it to the Babylonish captivity: &quot;The same sin,&quot;
he says, &quot;yea, the same punishment of sin which shall overturn Samaria, is to extend
to Judah, yea, even unto the gates of my city of Jerusalem. For, as Samaria was
overturned by the Assyrians, so Judah and Jerusalem shall be overturned by the Chaldeans.&quot;
This opinion was adopted by <i>Michaelis</i> and others.</p>
<p class="normal">At first sight, it would appear as if the circumstance, that the
judgment upon Judah is brought into immediate connection with that upon Israel,
favoured the first view. But this argument loses its weight when we remark, that
the events appear to the prophet in inward vision, and, therefore, quite irrespective
of their relation in time; that the continuity of the punitive judgment upon Israel
and Judah only, points out distinctly the truth, that both proceed from the same
cause, viz., the relation of divine justice to the sin of the Covenant-people. It
is this truth alone which forms the essence and soul of the prophetic threatenings;
and with reference to that, the difference in point of time, which is merely accidental,
is altogether kept out of view. Another argument in favour of the Assyrian invasion
might be derived from the expression, &quot;<i>to</i> Jerusalem,&quot; in ver. 9, inasmuch
as the Chaldean invasion visited Jerusalem itself. But, because the calamity was
not by any means to stop at Judah, but to overflow even it, it is shown by the preceding
expression, &quot;unto Judah,&quot; that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</span> (compare
on this word, <i>Dissertations on the Genuineness of Daniel</i>, p. 55 seq.) must,
in both cases, be explained from a tacit antithesis with the expectation,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 432]</span> that the judgment would either stop at the
boundary of Judah, or, although this should not be the case, would at least spare
the metropolis. The prophet contents himself with representing that this opinion
was erroneous. Although this passage itself asserts nothing upon the point as to
whether Jerusalem itself is to be thought of as the object of the divine punishment,
or whether it will be spared, the following reasons show that the former will be
the case. Even ver. 5 does not admit of our expecting anything else. Jerusalem is
there marked out as the chief seat and source of corruption in the kingdom of Judah,
just as is Samaria in the kingdom of Israel. The declaration which is there made
forms the foundation of the subsequent threatening. How is it possible, then, that,
while in the kingdom of Israel it is concentrated upon Samaria, in the kingdom of
Judah the seducer should be altogether passed over, and punishment announced to
the seduced only? That such is not the intention of the prophet, is clearly seen
from ver. 12: &quot;<i>For evil cometh down from the Lord upon the gate of Jerusalem.</i>&quot;
The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> alone is sufficient to prevent our
limiting the sense of these words, so that they mean only that evil will come no
farther than to the gate of Jerusalem, and will stop there. The <i>Particula causalis</i>
proves that they are the ground of the declaration in ver. 11, and that the mourning
will not cease at Beth-Haezel, &quot;the house of stopping;&quot; compare the remarks on Zech.
xiv. 5. But, altogether apart from this connection, the words themselves furnish
a proof. They contain a verbal reference to the description of the judgment upon
Sodom and Gomorrha, Gen. xix. 24. Jerusalem is marked out by them as a second Sodom
(compare Is. i. 10), upon which the divine judgments would discharge themselves.
As a second mark of this extension to Jerusalem, the carrying away of the people
into captivity is added (compare vers. 11, 15, 16), which, in the promise in chap.
ii. 12, 13, is supposed to have taken place. It is not Israel alone, but the whole
Covenant-people, who are in a state of dispersion, and are gathered from it by the
Lord.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, both of these marks are not applicable to the Assyrian invasion;
and if once we suppose the divine illumination of the prophet, it cannot be regarded
as the real object of his threatenings. This, too, is equally inadmissible, if we
consider the matter from a merely human point of view. The predictions
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 433]</span> of the prophets with regard to Assyria are,
from the very outset, rather encouraging. It is true that they are to be, in the
hand of the Lord, a rod of chastisement for His people, but these are never to be
altogether given up to them for destruction. By an immediate divine interference,
their plan of capturing Jerusalem is frustrated. Thus the matter is constantly represented
in Isaiah; thus also in Hosea i. 7. We can, moreover, adduce proofs from Micah himself,
that his spiritual eye was not pre-eminently, or exclusively, directed to the Assyrians.
In the prophecy from chap. iii. to v., where he describes the judgment upon Judah
in a manner altogether similar to that in which he mentions it here, he passes over
the Assyrians altogether in silence. Babylon is, in iv. 10, mentioned as the place
to which Judah is to be led into captivity.</p>
<p class="normal">Yet here, as well as everywhere else in the threatenings and promises
of the prophets, we must beware, lest, in referring them to some particular historical
event, we lose sight of the animating idea. If this, on the other hand, be rightly
understood, it will be seen that a particular historical event may indeed be pre-eminently
referred to, but that it can never exhaust the prophecy. Although, therefore, the
main reference here be to the destruction by the Chaldeans, we must not on that
account exclude anything in which the same law of retaliation was manifested, either
before, as in the invasion of the Syrians and Assyrians; or afterwards, as in the
destruction by the Romans. The prophet himself points, in iv. 11-14 (iv. 11-v. 1),
to two other phases of the divine judgment which are to follow upon that by the
Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="normal">After the prophet has thus hitherto described the impending divine
judgment in great general outlines, he passes on, in chap. ii., to chastise particular
vices, which, however, must always be at the same time, yea, prominently, considered
as indications of the wholly depraved condition of the nation, and of the punishments
to follow upon it. One feature upon which he here chiefly dwells, and which must,
therefore, have been a peculiarly prominent manifestation of the sinful corruption,
consists in the acts of injustice and oppression committed by the great, the description
of which presents striking resemblances to that in Is. v. 8 ff. The prophet interrupts
this description only in order <span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span> to rebuke the
false prophets, who reproved him for the severity of his discourses, and asserted
that they were unworthy of the merciful God. Such severity, answered the prophet,
was true mildness, because it alone could be the means of warding off the approaching
punitive judgment; that his God did not punish from want of forbearance&mdash;from want
of mercy; but that the fault was altogether that of the transgressors, who drew
down upon themselves, by force. His judgments.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_434a" href="#ftn_434a">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p class="normal">The prophecy closes with the promise in vers. 12, 13. It is introduced
quite abruptly, in order to place it in more striking contrast with the threatening;
just as, in iv. 1, there is a similar abrupt and unconnected contrast between the
promise and the threatening.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_434b" href="#ftn_434b">[3]</a></sup>
It is only brief; far more so than in the subsequent discourses, and far less detailed
than it is in them. The prophet desires first of all to terrify sinners from their
security; and for this reason, he causes only a very feeble glimmering of hope to
fall upon the dark future.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. &quot;<i>I will assemble, surely I will assemble, O Jacob,
thee wholly: I will gather the remnant of Israel. I will bring</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</span> <i>them together as the sheep of Bozrah; as
a flock on their pasture, they shall make a noise by reason of men.</i> Ver. 13.
<i>The breaker goeth up before them; they break through, pass through the gate and
go out, and their King marches before them, and the Lord is on the head of them.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The remark, that almost all the features of this description are
borrowed from the deliverance out of Egypt, will throw much light upon the whole
description. In the midst of oppression and misery, Israel, while there, increased
by means of the blessing of the Lord, hidden under the cross, to greater and greater
numbers; compare Exod. i. 12. When the time of deliverance had arrived, the Lord,
who had for a long time concealed Himself, manifested Himself again as their God.
First, the people were gathered together, and then, the Lord went before them,&mdash;in
a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night: Exod. xiii. 21. He led
them out of Egypt, the house of bondage: Exod. xx. 2. So it is here also. Ver. 12
describes the increase and gathering, and ver. 13 the deliverance. In both passages,
Israel&#39;s misery is represented under the figure of an abode in the house of bondage,
or in prison, the gates of which the Lord opens&mdash;the walls of which He breaks down.
In this allusion to, and connection with, the former deliverance, Micah agrees with
his contemporaries, Hosea and Isaiah. The deeper reason of this lies in the typical
import of the former deliverance, which forms a prophecy by deeds of all future
deliverances, and contains within itself completely their germ and pledge; compare
Hosea ii. 1, 2 (i. 10, 11); Is. xi. 11 ff.: &quot;And the Lord shall stretch forth His
hand a <i>second time</i> to redeem the remnant of His people.... And He sets up
an ensign for the nations, and gathers together the dispersed of Israel, and assembles
the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.... And the Lord smites
with a curse the tongue of the Egyptian sea, and shakes His hand over the river,
in the violence of His wind, and smites it to seven rivers, so that one may wade
through in shoes. And there shall be a highway to the remnant of His people, ...
like as it was to Israel in the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; This
reference to the typical deliverance clearly shows, that in the description we have
carefully to separate between the thought and the language in which it is clothed.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span></p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. The <i>Infin. absol.</i>, which in both the clauses precedes
the <i>tempus finitum</i>, expresses the emphasis which is to be placed on the
<i>gathering</i>, as opposed to the carrying away, and the scattering formerly announced;
for the latter, according to the view of man, and apart from God&#39;s mercy and omnipotence,
did not seem to admit of any favourable turn. By &quot;Jacob&quot; and &quot;Israel,&quot; several interpreters
understand Judah alone; others, the ten tribes alone; others, both together. The
last view is alone the correct one. This appears from i. 5, where, by Jacob and
Israel, the whole nation is designated. The promise in the passage before us stands
closely related to the threatening uttered there. All Israel shall be given up to
destruction on account of their sins; all Israel shall be saved by the grace of
God. This assumption is confirmed by a comparison of the parallel passages in Hosea
and Isaiah, where the whole is designated by the two parts, Judah and Israel. Micah
does not notice this division, because that visible separation, which even in the
present was overbalanced by an invisible unity, shall disappear altogether in that
future, when there shall be only one flock, as there is only one Shepherd. The expression,
&quot;remnant of Israel,&quot; in the second clause, which corresponds to, &quot;O Jacob, thee
wholly,&quot; in the first, indicates, that the fulfilment of the promise, so far from
doing away with the threatening, rather rests on its preceding realization. The
Congregation of God, purified by the divine judgments, shall be <i>wholly</i> gathered.
Divine mercy has in itself no limits; and those which in the present are assigned
to it by the objects of mercy, shall then be removed.&mdash;The words, &quot;I will bring them
together,&quot; etc., indicate equally the faithfulness of the great Shepherd, who gathers
His dispersed flock from all parts of the world, and the unexpected and wonderful
increase of the flock; compare Jer. xxiii. 3: &quot;And I will gather the remnant of
My flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and lead them back to
their pasture-ground, and they are fruitful and increase;&quot; and xxxi. 10: &quot;He that
scattereth Israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd does his flock.&quot;&mdash;Bozrah
we consider to be the name of a capital of the Idumeans in Auranitis, four days&#39;
journey from Damascus. The great wealth of this town in flocks appears from Is.
xxxiv. 6 (although a slaughter of men is spoken of in that passage, yet evidently
the wealth of Bozrah in natural <span class="pagenum">[Pg 437]</span> flocks is
there supposed), and can with perfect ease be accounted for from its situation.
For, in its neighbourhood, there begins the immeasurable plain of Arabia, which,
on one side, continues without interruption as far as <i>Dshof</i>, into the heart
of Arabia, while, towards the North, it extends to Bagdad, under the name of <i>
El Hamad</i>. Its length and breadth are calculated to amount to eight days&#39; journey.
It contains many shrubs and blooming plants; compare <i>Burkhardt</i> and <i>Ritter</i>.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_437a" href="#ftn_437a">[4]</a></sup>
Several interpreters consider <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;</span> to be an
appellative, and assign to it the signification &quot;sheepfold,&quot; &quot;cote.&quot; But there is
no reason whatsoever in favour of such a meaning of Bozrah, while there is this
argument against it, that the probable signification of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;</span> as the name of a town is &quot;<i>locus munitus</i>&quot;
= <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</span> or
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span>. It can hardly be supposed that
the word should at the same time have had the significations of &quot;fortress&quot; and &quot;fold.&quot;
It is, moreover, more in harmony with the prophetical character to particularize,
than to use a general term. As is shown, however, by the last member (with which,
according to the accents, the words, &quot;As <span class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span> a
flock on their pasture,&quot; must be connected), the point of comparison is not the
assembling and gathering, but the multitude, the crowd,&mdash;As the sheep of Bozrah&quot;
being thus tantamount to, &quot;So that in multitude they are like the sheep of Bozrah.&quot;
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</span>, from
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span>, is, contrary to the general rule,
doubly qualified, both by the article and by the suffix. This has been accounted
for on the ground that the little suffix had gradually lost its power. But it is
perhaps more natural to suppose that the article sometimes lost its power, and coalesced
with the noun. The frequent use of the <i>Status emphaticus</i> in undefined nouns,
in the Syriac language (compare <i>Hofmann</i>, <i>Gram. Syr.</i>, p. 290), presents
an analogy in favour of this opinion.&mdash;The last words graphically describe the noise
produced by a numerous, closely compacted flock. The plur. of the Fem. refers to
the sheep.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span> denotes the <i>causa efficiens</i>.
They make a noise; and this noise proceeds from the numerous assembled people. The
same connection of figure and thing occurs in Ezek. xxxiv. 31: &quot;And ye (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1503;</span>)
are My flock, the flock of My pasture are ye men;&quot; compare Ezek. xxxvi. 38.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 13. The whole verse must be explained by the figure of a
prison, which lies at the foundation. The people of God are shut up in it, but are
now delivered by God&#39;s powerful hand. By the &quot;breaker,&quot; many interpreters understand
the Lord Himself. But if we consider, that in a double clause, at the end of the
verse, the Lord is mentioned as the leader of the expedition if we look to the type
of the deliverance from Egypt, where Moses, as the breaker, marches in front of
Israel; and if, further, we look to the parallel passage in Hosea, where, with an
evident allusion to that type, the children of Israel and of Judah appoint themselves
one head; we shall rather be disposed to understand by the &quot;breaker&quot; the <i>dux
et antesignanus</i> raised up by God. With the raising up and equipping of such
a leader every divine deliverance commences; and that which, in the inferior deliverance,
the typical leaders, Moses and Zerubbabel, were, Christ was in the highest and last
deliverance. To Him the &quot;breaker&quot; has been referred by several Jewish interpreters
(compare <i>Schöttgen</i>, <i>Horæ</i> ii. p. 212); and if we compare chap. v.,
where that which is here indicated by general outlines only is further expanded
and detailed, we shall have to urge against this interpretation this objection only,
viz., that it excludes the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 439]</span> typical breakers,&mdash;that,
in the place of the <i>ideal</i> person of the breaker, which presents itself to
the internal vision of the prophet, it puts the individual in whom this idea is
most fully realized.&mdash;The words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; &#1513;&#1506;&#1512;</span>
are, by several interpreters, referred to the forcing and entering of hostile gates.
Thus <i>Michaelis</i>, whom <i>Rosenmüller</i> follows: &quot;No gate shall be so fortified
as to prevent them from forcing it.&quot; But this interpretation destroys the whole
figure, and violates the type of the deliverance from Egypt which lies at the foundation.
For the gate through which they break is certainly the gate of the prison.&mdash;The three
verbs&mdash;&quot;They break through, they pass through, they go out&quot;&mdash;graphically describe
their progress, which is not to be stopped by any human power.&mdash;The last words open
up the view to the highest leader of the expedition; compare besides, Exod. xiii.
21; Is. lii. 12: &quot;For ye shall not go out in trembling, nor shall ye go out by flight.
For the Lord goeth before you, and the God of Israel closeth your rear;&quot; Is. xl.
11; Ps. lxxx. 3. In the exodus from Egypt, a visible symbol of the presence of God
marched before the host, besides Moses, the breaker. On the return from Babylon,
the Angel of the Lord was visible to the eye of faith only, as formerly when Abraham&#39;s
servant journeyed to Mesopotamia, Gen. xxiv. 7. At the last and highest deliverance,
the breaker was at once the King and God of the people.</p>
<p class="normal">As this prophecy has no limitation at all in itself, we are fully
entitled to refer it to the whole sum of the deliverances and salvation which are
destined for the Covenant-people; and to seek for its fulfilment in every event,
either past or future, in the same degree as the fundamental idea&mdash;God&#39;s mercy upon
His people&mdash;is manifested in it. Every limitation to any particular event is evidently
inadmissible; but, most of all, a limitation to the deliverance from the Babylonish
captivity, which, especially with regard to Israel, can be considered as only a
faint prelude of the fulfilment. They, however, have come nearest to the truth who
assume an exclusive reference to Christ,&mdash;provided they acknowledge, that the conversion
of the first fruits of Israel, at the time when Christ appeared in His humiliation,
is not the end of His dealings with this people.</p>

	Robinson</i>, <i>Ritter</i> (<i>Erdk.</i> 14, 101), it has now become customary
	to distinguish between two Bozrahs,&mdash;one in Auranitis, and the other in Edom.
	But the arguments adduced for this distinction are not of very great weight.
	Nowhere is a &quot;high situation&quot; in reality ascribed to the Bozrah in Edom. The
	assertion, that Edom was always limited to the territory between the Dead Sea
	and the Red Sea, is opposed to Gen. xxxvi. 35, according to which passage, even
	in the time before Moses, the Edomitic king, Hadad, smote Midian in the field
	of Moab; and further, to Lam. iv. 21, according to which Edom dwells in the
	land of Uz, which can be sought for only in <i>Arabia Deserta</i>. We need to
	think only of that branch of the Midianites who had gone over to <i>Arabia Deserta</i>,
	whilst their chief settlement continued in <i>Arabia Petræa</i>. But the following
	arguments may be adduced <i>against</i> the distinction. 1. Bozrah is constantly
	and simply spoken of, without any further distinctive designation. 2. The Edomitic
	Bozrah must have been a great and powerful city, which agrees well with the
	&quot;mighty ruins&quot; in <i>Hauran</i>, but not with the much more insignificant ruins
	near <i>Busseireh</i> in <i>Dshebal</i>. 3. It is improbable that so important
	a city as that of Bozrah in Auranitis should never have been mentioned in Scripture.&mdash;But
	not satisfied with a double Bozrah, even a third, in Moab, has been assumed
	on the ground of Jer. xlviii. 24. But it is certainly strange that Bozrah, in
	that passage, is mentioned as the last of all the Moabitish towns, and that,
	immediately after its mention, there follow the words, &quot;Upon all the cities
	of the land of Moab, far and near.&quot; It may be that Bozrah was conquered by the
	Edomites and Moabites in common, or that, in later times, the latter obtained

<h3><a name="div3_440" href="#div3Ref_440">CHAP. III.-V.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The discourse opens with new reproofs and threatenings. It is
<i>first</i>, in vers. 1-4, directed against the rapacious great, who in ver. 2
are described as murderers of men (compare Sirach xxxi. 21: &quot;He who taketh from
his neighbour his livelihood, <i>killeth</i> him&quot;), and in ver. 3, as eaters of
men, because they turn to their own advantage the necessaries of life of which they
have robbed the poor. The discourse <i>then</i> passes over to the false prophets,
vers. 5-7. Their character is described as hypocritical, weak, and selfish, and
is incidentally contrasted with the character of the true prophet, as represented
by himself, whose strength is always renewed by the Spirit of the Lord, and who,
in this strength, serves only truth and righteousness, and holds up their sins to
the people deluded by the false prophets, ver. 8. This the prophet continues to
do in vers. 9-12. The three orders of divinely called rulers, upon whom the life
or death of the Congregation was depending,&mdash;the princes, the priests, and the prophets
(compare remarks on Zech. x. 1),&mdash;have become so degenerate, that they are not at
all concerned for the glory of God, but only for their own interest. And while they
have thus inwardly apostatized from Jehovah, they are strengthened in their false
security by the promises which God has given to His people, and which they, altogether
overlooking the fact that these are conditional, referred, in hypocritical blindness,
to themselves. But God will, in a fearful manner, punish them for this apostasy,
and frighten them from their security. The Congregation of the Lord, which has been
desecrated inwardly, shall be so outwardly also. Zion shall become a corn-field;
Jerusalem, the city of God, shall sink into rubbish and ruins; the Temple-hill shall
again become what it was previous to its being the residence of God, viz., a thickly
wooded hill, which shall then appear in all its natural lowness, and be considered
as insignificant when compared with the neighbouring mountains.&mdash;In the whole section,
the twelve verses of which are equally divided into three portions of four verses
each, the prophet views chiefly the great, and the civil rulers. The false prophets,
whom he takes up in the second of these subdivisions (vers. 5-8), come under consideration
as their helpers only. In the third subdivision, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 441]</span>
the discourse is again directed to the great alone, in vers. 9, 10. The two other
orders are added to them in vers. 11, 12 only; and the charges raised against them
refer to their relation to the great. The <i>priests</i> are not by any means reproved
because they made teaching a profession, from which they derived their livelihood,
but because, for bribes, they interpreted the law in a manner favourable to the
rapacious lusts of the great, and thereby, no less than the false prophets, assisted
them in their wickedness.&mdash;The charge raised in ver. 10 against the great,&mdash;Building
up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity,&quot;&mdash;has been frequently misunderstood.
The words must not be explained from Hab. ii. 12, but from Ps. li. 20, where David
prays to the Lord, &quot;Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem,&quot; which he had destroyed by
his blood, ver. 16. The word &quot;building&quot; is used ironically by Micah, and is tantamount
to: &quot;Ye who are destroying Jerusalem by blood and iniquity (compare ver. 12: &#39;For
your sakes Zion shall be ploughed as a field&#39;), instead of building it up by righteousness.&quot;
Righteousness builds up, because it draws down God&#39;s blessing and protection; but
unrighteousness destroys, because it calls down the curse of God.</p>
<p class="normal">The unfaithfulness of the Covenant-people can nevertheless not
make void the faithfulness of God. The prophet, therefore, passes suddenly from
threatening to promise. <i>Calvin</i> thus expresses the relation of these two:
&quot;But I must now come to the little remnant. Hitherto I have spoken about the judgment
of God, which is near at hand, upon the king&#39;s councillors, upon the priests and
prophets, upon the whole people in short, because they are all wicked and ungodly,
because the whole body is pervaded by contempt of God, and by desperate obstinacy.
Let them receive, then, that which they all have deserved. But I now gather the
children of God apart, for to them too I have a message to deliver.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The intimate relation of the first part of the promise to the
preceding threatening has been already demonstrated, p. 420. The Mount of Zion,
which forms the subject of vers. 1-7, shall, in future, not only be restored to
its former dignity, but it shall be exalted above all the mountains of the earth.
The kingdom of God, which is represented by it, shall, by the glory imparted to
it by a new revelation of the Lord (compare ver. 7: &quot;And <span class="pagenum">[Pg
442]</span> the Lord shall be King over them on Mount Zion&quot;), outshine all the kingdoms
of the world, and exercise an attractive power upon their citizens; so that they
flow to Zion, there to receive the commands of the Lord, vers. 1, 2. By the sway
which the Lord exercises from Zion, peace shall have its dwelling in the heathen
world, ver. 3, and, consequently, the Congregation of the Lord ceases to be a prey
to injury from the world&#39;s power, ver. 4<sup>a</sup>. How incredible soever it may
appear, this promise shall surely be fulfilled; for omnipotent faithfulness has
given it, ver. 4<sup>b</sup>, and has given it indeed for this very purpose; for
it is altogether natural, and to be expected, that the glory of the Lord should
in all eternity display itself in His dealings with His people, ver. 5. In vers.
6, 7, the promise receives a new impetus, by which it connects itself with ver.
4<sup>a</sup>. In that time of mercy, the Lord will put an end to all the misery
of His people.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 1. &quot;<i>And it shall come to pass at the end of the days,
that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be firmly established on the top
of the mountains, and exalted above the hills, and people flow unto it.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The words, &quot;And it shall come to pass,&quot; excite the attention to
the great and unexpected turn which things are to take. The expression,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, is explained by many as meaning:
&quot;In times to come,&quot; &quot;in future.&quot; But we have already proved, in our work on <i>Balaam</i>,
p. 465 seq., that the right explanation is: &quot;At the end of the days.&quot; This is the
explanation given by the LXX. also, who commonly render it by
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#967;&#8049;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#963; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span>; and by the Chaldee
Paraphrast, who translates it by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1505;&#1493;&#1507; &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488;</span>.
The reasons which seem, at first sight, to favour the signification &quot;in future,&quot;
are invalidated by these two considerations:&mdash;<i>first</i>, that it is not at all
necessary that the end be just absolutely the last, but only the end of those events
which the speaker is reviewing; and, <i>second</i>, that it altogether depends upon
the will of the speaker, what extent he is to assign to the beginning and to the
end. The expression is used by the prophets in a manner different from that of the
Pentateuch. The prophets use it almost exclusively with a reference to the Messianic
times,&mdash;an <i>usus loquendi</i> which originated in Deut. iv. 30. They divide the
whole duration of the kingdom of God into two parts, the beginning and the end,&mdash;the
state of humiliation, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span> the state of glorification.
The line of demarcation is formed by the birth of the Messiah, according to v. 2
(3): &quot;He will give them up until she who is bearing brings forth.&quot;&mdash;The mountain
of the house of the Lord&quot; is, according to the common <i>usus loquendi</i>, not
Moriah, but the whole mountain of Zion, of which Moriah was considered as a part;
compare Ps. lxxvi. 3, lxxviii. 68. In ver. 8, the prophet speaks of two parts only,
Zion and Jerusalem. In iii. 12, Zion only, as the better part, is first spoken of;
and then, in the second clause, Jerusalem and the mountain of the house, the latter
corresponding to Zion, are contrasted with each other, or Jerusalem and Mount Zion
considered in its highest quality as the temple-mountain.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;</span>,
&quot;fixed,&quot; &quot;firmly established,&quot; implies more than, simply, &quot;placed.&quot; It shows that
the change is not merely momentary, but that the temple-mountain shall be exalted
for ever, and that no earthly power shall be able to abase it. It thus goes hand
in hand with the declaration in ver. 7: &quot;The Lord shall be king over them from now
<i>until eternity</i>.&quot; The same word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;</span>
is used in 1 Kings ii. 45 of the immutable firmness of the throne of David: &quot;The
throne of David shall be firmly established before the Lord for ever;&quot; compare 2
Sam. vii. 12, 13. The commentary on <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;</span> is
given by Dan. ii. 44: &quot;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed in all eternity ... it shall break in
pieces and destroy all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.&quot; That
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span> does not mean, &quot;at the head of
the mountains,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, standing at the head, as the first among them (as
<i>Hitzig</i> and others think), but &quot;on the summit of the mountains&quot; (the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;</span> is used in a similar manner in Judg. ix.
7, compared with 1 Sam. xxvi, 13), is evident from the fact that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;</span>, in connection with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;</span>, is constantly used of the summit of the
mountains, and, hence, cannot be used in a figurative sense, in this connection.
The sense can therefore be this only: &quot;Zion, in future, so pre-eminently stands
out from among the other mountains, that these serve, as it were, only for its foundation.&quot;
Now, the elevation of the temple-mountain is considered, by several interpreters,
as a <i>physical</i> one. Passages from Jewish commentaries, in which the expectation
is expressed that, in the days of the Messiah, Jehovah would bring near Mount Carmel
and Tabor, and place Jerusalem on <span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span> the summit
of them, will be found in <i>Galatinus</i>, <i>de Arcanis Catholicæ Veritatis</i>,
L. v. c. 3. The literal explanation has, in recent times, been defended by <i>Hofmann</i>
and <i>Drechsler</i>. But <i>Caspari</i>, by pointing out the exact correspondence
between the words, &quot;The mountain of the house of the Lord shall be firmly established
on the top of the mountains,&quot; and the words in ver. 2, &quot;The law shall go forth of
Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,&quot; has proved in a very striking manner
that the elevation is a moral one. &quot;As 1<sup>b</sup> corresponds to 2<sup>a</sup>,
so does 1<sup>a</sup> to 2<sup>b</sup>; ver. 1<sup>a</sup> is the ground of ver.
1<sup>b</sup>; ver. 2<sup>a</sup>, by which ver. 1<sup>b</sup> is further expanded,
is the consequence of 2<sup>b</sup>. Hence 2<sup>b</sup> must be substantially identical
with ver. 1<sup>a</sup>; but 2<sup>b</sup> speaks of something that points to the
moral height of Mount Zion, and states something upon which it is based.&quot; To this
it may be added, that height, in a moral sense, is often ascribed to the temple-mountain,
even with reference to the ante-Messianic time, and that the passage under consideration
could be disjoined from these by force only. It is upon such a view of it, indeed,
that the use of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;</span> in reference to the journeys
to Jerusalem rests, just as it is here used in ver. 2. We may, moreover, compare
Ps. xlviii. 3; Ezek. xvii. 22, 33: &quot;And I plant upon a mountain high and elevated.
On the high mountains of Israel I will plant it;&quot; but especially Ps. lxviii. 16:
&quot;Mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan, the top of mountains is the mountain
of Bashan.&quot; Ver. 17. &quot;Why do ye tops of mountains insidiously observe the mountain
which God desireth for His residence? Yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.&quot;
The mountain of God is, in these verses, an emblem of the kingdoms of the world,
which are powerful through God&#39;s grace. In ver. 16, the Psalmist declares what the
mountain of Bashan is. In ver. 17, he rejects the unfounded claims which it raises
on account of its real advantages. Although it be great, yet Mount Zion is infinitely
greater, and vain are all its efforts to overturn this relation. This passage, then,
leads to another argument against the literal interpretation. We find in it the
kingdoms represented under the figure of mountains,<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_444a" href="#ftn_444a">[1]</a></sup>&mdash;a
mode of representation which is of very frequent occurrence in Scripture; compare
my Commentary on <span class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</span> Ps. lxv. 7, lxxvi. 5; Rev.
viii. 8, xvii. 9. The more difficult it was to separate, according to the Israelitish
conception, <i>mountain</i> and <i>kingdom</i>, the more natural it was to find,
in the passage before us, expression given to the thought, that the kingdom of God
would, in future, be exalted above all the kingdoms of the world. If we take into
account the common practice of employing &quot;mountain&quot; in a figurative sense, it is
natural to suppose that not the exaltation alone is to be understood figuratively,
but that the mountain itself also is to be regarded chiefly in its symbolical signification,&mdash;as
the symbol of the kingdom of God in Israel; although, in this aspect, we should
expect, at least in the beginning of the relation, that the thing itself should
still be connected with the symbol; afterwards they may be disjoined without any
hesitation. The deep grief which must, of necessity, have been called forth by the
announcement in iii. 12, did not regard the mountain as such. It had, for its real
object, the condition of the kingdom of God which was prefigured by the condition
of the mountain; and it is just this to which the consolation has respect.&mdash;But by
what means is the exaltation of the temple-mountain to be effected? <i>Cocceius</i>
has already directed attention to the circumstance, that it must not be supposed
to consist in the flowing of the people unto it; for that is not the <i>cause</i>,
but the <i>effect</i>. We find the correct answer in ver. 2: &quot;The law goeth forth
of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;&quot; and in ver. 7: &quot;And the Lord
will be king over them on Mount Zion.&quot; The exaltation will, accordingly, be effected
by a glorious manifestation of the Lord within His congregation; in consequence
of which, Zion becomes the centre of the whole earth. That this manifestation is
to take place in Christ, is brought out only subsequently; compare especially, v.
1, 3 (2-4). A parallel passage is also Ezek. xl. 2, where Mount Zion is likewise
seen exalted in the Messianic time.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 2. &quot;<i>And many nations go and say, Come and let us go up
to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach
us His ways, and that we may walk in His path; for from Zion the law shall go forth,
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">From the words, &quot;And many nations go,&quot; to &quot;paths,&quot; we have an
expansion of&mdash;&quot;People flow unto it.&quot; Zech. viii. 20-23 are founded upon, and serve
as a commentary on the passage before <span class="pagenum">[Pg 446]</span> us.
The people go to one another, and send messengers to one another; a powerful commotion
pervades the heathen world, which causes them to seek Zion, that had formerly been
despised by them. It makes no substantial difference whether the going is to be
understood physically or spiritually,&mdash;whether the people flow to the literal Mount
Zion, or to the Church, which is thereby prefigured. All that is requisite is, that
the commencement of their going and flowing must belong to a time in which the symbol
and the thing symbolized were still connected,&mdash;when the literal Zion was still the
seat of the Church. The <i>plurality</i> of nations forms a contrast with the <i>
unity</i>, but not with the <i>universality</i>, as is shown by a comparison of
the parallel passage in Isaiah, where the &quot;many people&quot; are preceded by the mention
of &quot;all the heathens (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, <i>i.e.</i>,
the whole heathen world) flow unto it,&quot; instead of&mdash;&quot;People flow unto it,&quot; as in
Micah. Formerly, <i>one</i> people only went to Zion, in order there to offer to
the Lord their worship, and to be taught His ways, Exod. xxiii. 17, xxxiv. 23; Deut.
xxxi. 10 sqq.; now, many people flow thither. In the anticipation of this future
glory of Mount Zion, which will infinitely outshine that of the present, the sad
interval described in iii. 12, during which the mountain of the house is altogether
forsaken, may be more easily borne. The connection of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span>,
which is rather uncommon, may be most simply explained by viewing the instruction
as proceeding from its object. &quot;The ways of the Lord&quot; are the ways in which He would
have men to walk,&mdash;that mode of life which is well-pleasing to Him. The contrast
of it is walking in one&#39;s own ways. Is. liii. 6,&mdash;regulating of one&#39;s life according
to the desires of one&#39;s own corrupt heart.&mdash;The last words, &quot;For from Zion, etc.,&quot;
are not to be conceived of as spoken by the people, stirring up and encouraging
one another, but by the prophet. They state the reason why the people are so anxious
to go to Zion; and this accounts also for the circumstance that Zion is so emphatically
placed at the beginning. Zion shall, at that time, be the residence of the true
God, and proved to be such by glorious revelations; and from it His commands go
forth over the whole earth. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;</span>, &quot;to go out,&quot;
stands here, as in ver. 1, in the sense of &quot;to go forth.&quot; As the sphere for the
going forth of the law from Zion is not limited, it must be considered in as wide
an extent as possible; in harmony with the preceding words,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 447]</span> according to which we must think of &quot;people,&quot;
&quot;many nations,&quot; as being comprehended within this sphere.&mdash;We must not overlook the
fact that the article is awanting before <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span>,
and that the law is not more strictly defined as the law of God. It is intended,
in the first place, only to indicate that despised and desolate Zion is to be the
seat of legislation for the whole earth. The law itself is then more strictly defined
as the word of God. Many interpreters understand <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> here as meaning religion in general;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_447a" href="#ftn_447a">[2]</a></sup>
the going forth is explained by them of its spreading itself. From Zion, true religion
is to extend over all the nations; and hence it is that to Zion the eyes of all
of them are directed. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Theodoret</i>, who remarks: &quot;This is
the preaching of the Gospel, which began at Jerusalem, and from thence, as from
its source, flowed over all the earth, offering drink to those who came to it in
faith.&quot; But <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> never signifies &quot;doctrine,&quot;
&quot;religion,&quot; any more than does <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;</span>: it is
always used as meaning &quot;law;&quot; and this sense of it can with the less propriety be
departed from here, as the people, according to what precedes, flow to Zion not
in order to seek religion in general, but laws for their conduct in life. But even
if we were to follow <i>Caspari</i>, and to modify the explanation thus, &quot;The law,
which was formerly confined to Zion, and hence to a narrow circle, shall go forth
from thence into the wide world,&quot;&mdash;weighty objections to it would still remain. If
&quot;to go forth&quot; were to be understood as meaning &quot;to spread,&quot; the sphere of the going
forth would have been more closely determined; as, <i>e.g.</i>, in Is. xlii. 1:
&quot;He shall bring forth judgment <i>to the Gentiles</i>.&quot; In Is. li. 4, &quot;Law shall
<i>go out</i> from Me, and My judgment I will make for a light of the people,&quot;
<i>to go out</i> is tantamount to, <i>to go forth</i>. &quot;Mine arms shall judge the
people,&quot; in li. 5, is parallel to it. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;</span>
in itself does not mean &quot;to go forth.&quot; <i>Further</i>&mdash;The circumstance that the
law spreads from Zion, does not account sufficiently for the zeal with which the
nations flow to Zion. If it <i>goes out</i>, there is then no need for their seeking
for it at its home. In Zech. viii. 20-23, also, the thronging of the people to Zion,
in order to enter there into a closer relation to the Lord, forms the subject of
discourse. Zion, as the place where the Lord of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 448]</span>
the whole earth issues His orders, as if from His residence (Is. xi. 10), forms
an appropriate contrast to &quot;Zion shall be ploughed as a field,&quot;&mdash;a suitable parallel
to the exaltation of the temple-mountain above all the mountains of the earth, to
which the prophet here returns, after having, in the first part of the verse, expanded
the thought: &quot;People flow unto it;&quot; and to vers. 7, 8 also, where Zion appears likewise
as the seat of dominion.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And He judges among many people, and rebukes strong
nations, even unto a distance. And they heat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-knives; nation shall not lift up a sword, against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">It appears strange to us that here we see ourselves transferred
all at once to the sphere of the general description of the Messianic time; for,
according to the whole context, and to the contrast with chap. iii., we expect such
predictions as will serve especially for the consolation of the daughter of Zion,
whose heart had been pierced by the announcement that the mountain of the house
should become a wooded hill, and that she herself should be given into the power
of the Gentiles. But this difficulty is removed by remarking that this verse only
prepares the way for ver. 4, where there is a representation of the advantage which
accrues to the daughter of Zion from the spirit of peace, which, through the powerful
influence of Zion&#39;s God, has become prevalent in the heathen world. It is from failing
to perceive the connection of the two verses, that the remark of <i>Hitzig</i> has
arisen: &quot;It is very probable that Micah, if he had been the (original) author, would
rather have mentioned the change and restoration of Jerusalem, than the change of
the arms.&quot;&mdash;The subject is the Lord. That it was through <i>Christ</i>, who as early
as in the Song of Solomon appears as the true Solomon, that the Lord would carry
out what is here announced, the prophet could, according to his plan, detail only
afterwards. In chap. iv. 1-7, he describes how Zion is glorified by what the Lord
does from thence; in ver. 8, by the restoration of the dominion of the Davidic race;
and in v. 1 ff., by the appearance of the Messiah. It is especially from v. 3 (4),
according to which the Messiah stands and feeds in the strength of the Lord, in
the majesty of the name of the Lord His God,&mdash;and from v. 4 (5), according
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 449]</span> to which He is the Peace, that we infer with
certainty that the judging also shall be done by His mediation. In Isaiah we meet
the person of the Messiah in the prophecy of chap. iv., which, along with that in
chap. ii., belongs to one discourse, and supplements it. The judging and rebuking
(<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;</span> with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1500;</span>, &quot;to rebuke,&quot; &quot;to reprove&quot;) refer to the strifes among the nations which
hitherto could not be allayed, because there was wanting the counterpoise to selfishness
which was productive of wrong. But such a counterpoise is now given in the word
of God, which, carried home by His Spirit, penetrates deeply into the heart.&mdash;<i>Strong</i>
nations,&quot; who were hitherto most ready to seize the sword. The words, &quot;And they
beat,&quot; etc., refer to Joel iv. (iii.) 10, where the heathen beat their ploughshares
into swords, their pruning-knives into spears; and they do so to the prejudice of
the people of God, which the prophet, although apparently he speaks in general terms,
has specially in view. By this allusion Micah indicates that, with reference to
the disposition of the heathen world, Joel has spoken a word, true, indeed, but
giving only a partial view. The words of <i>Justinus</i> in the <i>Dialogus cum
Tryphone</i>&mdash;For, having learned the fear and worship of God from the Law and Gospel
which came to us through the Apostles from Jerusalem, we have fled for refuge to
the God of Jacob, and the God of Israel; and we, who formerly were filled with war
and murder, and every wickedness, have put away the instruments of war from the
whole earth, and have, every one of us, changed the swords into ploughshares, and
the spears into agricultural implements, and cultivate the fear of God, justice,
brotherly love, faith, hope,&quot; etc.,&mdash;show that, even soon after the appearance of
Christ, it was held that the fulfilment of this prophecy had commenced. But it was
acknowledged by the prophet also, that even after the appearance of the salvation,
this description would, in the meantime, give only a partial exhibition of the truth;
inasmuch as not every one will submit to the judging activity of the Lord, how powerful
soever may be the effect of the new principle which entered into the life of the
nations; for in v. 4, 5 (5, 6) he speaks of the nations which, in the Messianic
time, attack the people of God; in ver. 8 (9), of their adversaries and enemies;
and in ver. 14 (15), of such as do not hear. But the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span>
imperfect fulfilment is a pledge and guarantee for that which is perfect, as it
will take place when, by the last judgment, they have been removed who have obstinately
preserved within themselves the spirit of strife and hatred. According to the predictions
of the prophets&mdash;compare especially Is. xi. 6, 7&mdash;peace shall, at some future period,
be extended even to the irrational creation, and the strife which has come upon
earth by the fall, shall entirely cease from it.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>And they sit every man under his vine, and under his
fig-tree, and none maketh them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken
it.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">This verse contains a description of the happy consequences which
the peaceful influence which goes forth from the Lord to the heathen world, shall
have upon Israel. For Israel is the subject in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1489;&#1493;</span>,
and the verse does not at all pretend to give a description of &quot;a Solomonic time
for all the nations.&quot; This is shown by what is stated, in the following verse, as
to the ground of this happy change, as well as by a comparison of the fundamental
passages. Lev. xxvi. 6: &quot;And I give peace in the land, and ye lie down, and none
maketh you afraid;&quot; and 1 Kings v. 5 (iv. 25): &quot;And Judah and Israel dwelt safely
every man under his vine and fig-tree, from Dan to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon;&quot;
and of the parallel passages, Micah v. 4 (5); Zech. iii. 10. It is <i>further</i>
shown by the connection with what precedes, where great calamity, and the devastation
of their whole country had been predicted to Israel,&mdash;and by the mention of the vine
and fig-tree, which are characteristic of the land of Israel. The words, &quot;For the
mouth of the Lord,&quot; etc., point out the pledge, which the person of Him who promises
affords for the fulfilment of the promise, which appears incredible.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 5. &quot;<i>For all the nations shall walk, every one in the name
of their God; and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The causal particle <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> states
the ground of the fact that the Lord of hosts has spoken this, and given the promise
of the final safety of Israel, and of his enjoying peace after the strife, in consequence
of God&#39;s exercising dominion from Zion over the whole heathen world; while this
peace after the strife is then more fully described in vers. 6, 7. The lot of every
people corresponds to the nature of their God. And now, how
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span> could it be otherwise, than that all other
nations should be humbled, because their gods are idols, while Israel, on the other
hand, is exalted and endowed with everlasting salvation and prosperity, because
his God is the only true God? Is. xlv. 16, 17 is parallel: &quot;They shall be ashamed,
and also confounded, all of them; they shall go to confusion, the makers of idols.
Israel is saved by the Lord, with an everlasting salvation; ye shall not be ashamed
nor confounded in all eternity.&quot;&mdash;The name of the Lord&quot; is the complex whole of His
excellency which is revealed, and proved by deeds; compare Prov. xviii. 10: &quot;The
name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it and is exalted.&quot;
Inasmuch as the name of the Lord is to manifest itself in His dealings with His
people, it represents itself as the way in which they are to walk: the prayer of
the Psalmist in Ps. xxv. 5, that the Lord would lead him in His <i>truth</i>, forms
a parallel to this; and so does also what he says in ver. 9 of the same Psalm, that
&quot;He guides the meek in <i>judgment</i>.&quot; But exactly corresponding is Zech. x. 12:
&quot;And I strengthen them in the Lord, and <i>in His name shall they walk</i>&quot; = in
the path of His name, so that the latter manifests itself in His dealings with them;
compare the remarks on that passage. In favour of our exposition, moreover, is the
comparison of the passage Is. ii. 5, the evidently requisite harmony of which with
the passage under consideration is obtained, only if the latter be understood as
we have explained it. The <i>light</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the salvation of the Lord spoken
of there, corresponds with the name of the Lord in the passage under review. Several
interpreters explain: &quot;They may walk, they may worship their gods. Although all
nations should be idolaters, yet we, inhabitants of Judah, shall faithfully worship
Jehovah.&quot; Against this explanation <i>Caspari</i> remarks, &quot;An exhortation, or a
resolution which implies an exhortation, is here not easily justified, because it
would stand in the midst of promises.&quot; Moreover, the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> cannot be explained according to this interpretation,
as appears with sufficient clearness from the remark of <i>Justi</i>: &quot;This verse
does not seem to be so closely connected with the preceding one.&quot; The connection
is more firmly established by the explanation of <i>Tarnovius</i>, <i>Michaelis</i>,
and others: &quot;Surely so brilliant a lot must fall to us; for we are faithful worshippers
of the true God, while all other nations walk after their idols.&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span> But the objections to tins explanation are:
(1) the circumstance that it is rather unusual to found the salvation of the people
upon their covenant-faithfulness (of which, from the preceding reproof, we cannot
entertain very high notions), instead of founding it upon God&#39;s grace and faithfulness,
compare vii. 18-20;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_452a" href="#ftn_452a">[3]</a></sup>
(2) the repeated use of the Future, while, according to it, we should have expected
the Preterite, at least in the first member; and (3), and most decisive of all,
the expression, &quot;For ever and ever;&quot; compare the expression, &quot;From henceforth, even
for ever,&quot; in ver. 7.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 6. &quot;<i>In that day, saith the Lord, I will assemble that
which halteth, and that which hath been driven out I will gather, and that which
I have afflicted.</i> Ver. 7. <i>And I make that which is halting a remnant, and
that which is far off a strong nation, and the Lord reigneth over them in Mount
Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The expression &quot;in that day&quot; does not refer to &quot;at the end of
the days,&quot; in ver. 1, but is connected with, and resumes ver. 4<sup>a</sup> That
the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;</span> has here the signification &quot;to
assemble,&quot; and not that &quot;to receive,&quot; is shown by ii. 12, and especially by Ezek.
xi. 17. The word refers to the announcement of Israel&#39;s being carried away, which
was formerly made, and with which the scattering is connected. They are assembled
for their return to the Holy Land. Such an assembling, however, is meant, as is
connected with the full enjoyment of salvation, and in which the Congregation truly
manifests itself in a close unity, as a kingdom of priests. In the passage, Zeph.
iii. 19, which is founded upon the one under review, we find &quot;I save&quot; instead of
&quot;I assemble.&quot; Of such a description, the assembling under Zerubbabel was not; compare
Nehem. ix. 36, 37. It can therefore come into notice only as a prelude to the true
assembling.&mdash;The Fem. sing. of the Partic.,&quot; says <i>Hitzig</i>, &quot;must be understood
collectively; and it is not several subjects, but predicates of the same subject,
viz., of the whole of Israel, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 453]</span> which are thereby
designated.&quot; The &quot;halting,&quot; which is a condition of bodily helplessness and weakness,
occurs also in Ps. xxxv. 15, and xxxviii. 18, as a designation of adversity and
misery.&mdash;The expression, &quot;to make a remnant,&quot; forms the contrast to total annihilation.
While these words show that a limit will be put to the <i>diminution</i>, the following
words predict a vast <i>increase</i>. In the words, &quot;In Mount Zion,&quot; the contrast
with iii. 12 appears once more at the close of the section. As regards
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>, compare Ps. xciii. 1. It does not
refer to the constant government of the Lord, but to a new and glorious manifestation
of it&mdash;as it were to a new ascension to the throne. The expression, &quot;From henceforth,&quot;
refers to the <i>ideal</i> present. In spirit, the prophet is in that time when
the Lord is just entering upon His government. The words, &quot;The Lord reigneth ...
for ever,&quot; are thus beautifully illustrated by <i>Calvin</i>: &quot;Micah does not here
mention the descendants of David, but Jehovah Himself; not as if he wished thereby
to exclude that dominion of David, but in order to show that God would make it manifest
that He was the author of that dominion, yea, that He Himself held all the power.
For, although God governed the ancient people by the hand of David, and by the hand
of Josiah and Hezekiah, <i>yet there was, as it were, a shadow placed between, so
that God&#39;s government was then perceived darkly only.</i> The prophet, therefore,
here expresses, that there would be some difference betwixt that shadowy government,
and the future new dominion which He was openly to set up by the advent of the Messiah.
And this was truly and solidly fulfilled in Christ&#39;s person. For although Christ
was the true seed of David, yet He was also, at the same time, Jehovah, viz., God
made manifest in the flesh.&quot; With respect to this promise, however, it must also
be kept in mind that it will be finally fulfilled only in the future, when the kingdom
and throne of glory (compare Matt. xix. 28) shall be set up.</p>
<p class="normal">The prophet had hitherto described the kingdom which was to be
established anew, as a kingdom of God, without mentioning the channel through which
His mercy was to be poured out upon the Congregation&mdash;the mediator who was to represent
Him among them. His representation, therefore, was still defective; it still wanted
the connection with the promise given to David, and so frequently celebrated by
him, and by other <span class="pagenum">[Pg 454]</span> holy Psalmists and Prophets&mdash;the
promise of the eternal dominion of David&#39;s house. According to this promise, every
new, great manifestation of grace, must be through some descendant of this family
as a mediator. This house must ever form the substratum on which the divine power
and the divine nature, in its most complete manifestation, showed themselves. This
blank is supplied in ver. 8.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;<i>And thou tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion,
unto thee it will come; and to thee cometh the former dominion, the kingdom of the
daughter of Zion.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In the words immediately preceding it is said: &quot;And the Lord reigneth
over them from henceforth, even for ever.&quot; We have here, then, a prediction of the
dominion of the house of David, by whose mediation the Lord is to reign; compare
v. 3 (4), where it is said of Him in whom the Davidic race is to centre, &quot;And He
stands, and feeds in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the
Lord His God.&quot; All interpreters agree that the Davidic race is designated by the
&quot;Tower of the flock,&quot; and by &quot;the hill of the daughter of Zion;&quot; but, with respect
to the ground of this designation, they are very much at variance. A great number
of them (<i>Grotius</i>, and among the recent interpreters, <i>Rosenmüller</i>,
<i>Winer</i>, <i>Gesenius</i>, <i>De Wette</i>) think of that Tower of the flock,
in the neighbourhood of which Jacob, according to Gen. xxxv. 21, took up his abode
for a time. They say that, according to <i>Jerome</i>, this Tower of the flock was
situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Bethlehem; that it is used here only
by way of a <i>metalepsis</i> for Bethlehem, and that Bethlehem again designates
the Davidic race; so that the passage agrees altogether with v. 1 (2). But, upon
a closer examination, this interpretation appears to be objectionable, for the following
reasons. 1. It is anything but fixed that that Tower of the flock was situated in
the immediate neighbourhood of Bethlehem. It cannot be inferred from the passage
in Genesis, and as little can it be proved from <i>Jerome</i>. In the <i>Quest.
ad Genes. Opp.</i> iii. p. 145, Frcf., he first mentions the opinion of the Jews,
according to which, by the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; is to be understood the place on
which the temple was afterwards built, and then says: &quot;But if we follow the direction
of the road, we find, by Bethlehem, a &#39;place of the shepherds,&#39; which was so called,
either because it was there <span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span> that, at the birth
of the Lord, the angels sang their hymn of praise; or because Jacob fed his flock
there, and gave this name to the place; or, which is more likely, because even then
the future mystery was, by a revelation, shown to him.&quot; According to this, <i>Jerome</i>
does not know anything of a &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; near Bethlehem. From the direction
of the road which Jacob took, he only <i>surmises</i> that it was situated thereabouts;
and since there was, in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, a place called &quot;the place
of the shepherds,&quot; he, from a mere combination, declares this to be identical with
the Tower of the flock; while, after all, he is so cautious as not at once to reject
the only true derivation of this name from the shepherds at the birth of Christ.
By this, the other passage in the book <i>de locis Hebr.</i> must be judged, where
<i>Jerome</i> expressly delivers his supposition as if it were historical truth:
&quot;Bethlehem, the city of David ... and about a thousand paces (<i>passus</i>) distant
is the tower <i>Ader</i>, which is called &#39;the Tower of the flock,&#39; indicating that,
by some vision, the shepherds had, beforehand, been made conscious of the birth
of the Lord.&quot; That tradition knew but little of any &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; in the
neighbourhood of Bethlehem, appears also from <i>Eusebius Onom.</i> s. v. <i>Gader.</i>
p. 79, ed. <i>Cleric</i>: &quot;The tower Gader ... While Jacob dwelt there, Reuben went
in to Bilhah.&quot; <i>Eusebius</i> evidently knew nothing more regarding the &quot;Tower
of the flock&quot; than what we also may learn from the passage in Genesis. He does not
venture to offer even a conjecture as to its position. The same ignorance is shown
by the Jews, mentioned by <i>Jerome</i>, who certainly would not have thought of
a reference to the temple, if a place called &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; had existed in
the neighbourhood of Bethlehem. 2. But even assuming the existence of the Tower
of the flock in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, is it anything else than the assumption
of a pure <i>quid pro quo</i>, to assert, without assigning any reason, that the
&quot;Tower of the flock&quot; stands for Bethlehem? <i>Rosenmüller</i>, at least, has felt
this. He makes the attempt to assign a reason: &quot;In substituting, however, an unknown
hamlet in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, for Bethlehem itself, he intended to indicate
that the dominion of David would be altogether weakened and brought low.&quot; But this
reason is certainly not by any means sufficient; Bethlehem was, in itself, so small,
that no further <span class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</span> diminution was required; compare
v. 1 (2). It had, moreover, been always small, and had not by any means sunk down
in the course of time from former greatness. Hence, such a designation, in contrast
with its former glory, would be entirely out of place; and even supposing that it
were not, the mode of this designation would always be inexplicable, unless we could
assume a closer reference of the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; to the Davidic family. It
is only by establishing such a reference, that the whole explanation can be saved
and confirmed. For this purpose, it would be necessary to suppose that Bethlehem,
and the district belonging to it, were the general designation of the native place
of the Davidic family, while the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; was the special one. But there
is not the slightest ground on which to support this hypothesis. Everywhere, Bethlehem
itself appears as the residence of Jesse, the father of David (compare 1 Sam. xvi.
1, 18, 19, xvii. 12), and likewise of Boaz, Ruth ii. 4.</p>
<p class="normal">The incorrectness of another explanation is still more evident.
According to it, we are, by the &quot;Tower of the flock,&quot; to understand a tower which
is alleged to have stood at Jerusalem, near to the Sheep-gate. But the existence
of such a tower is supported by no evidence whatsoever, and does not become even
probable by the existence of a sheep-gate; for a Tower of the flock is not a tower
which stands near the Sheep-gate, but a tower which is erected for the protection
of the flock, as is clearly seen from <i>Migdal Eder</i> in Genesis. But, even supposing
that such a tower existed, is there anything which could somehow make it a suitable
designation of the Davidic family?</p>
<p class="normal">Let us now proceed to the establishment of our own opinion, by
which the arguments advanced against the other explanations will be considerably
strengthened. Concerning the situation of Jerusalem, <i>Josephus</i>, <i>de B. J.</i>
i. 6, c. 13, remarks as follows: &quot;It was built on two hills fronting each other,
separated by a chasm running between, down to which the houses were situated. One
of the hills, on which the upper part of the city lay, was much higher and longer
than the other. And, because it was fortified, it was called the Citadel of King
David,&quot; etc. These two hills are Akra and Zion. The city situated upon the latter,
is, in other passages also, described by Josephus to be very high and steep; <i>
e.g.</i>, vi. 40: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#969; &#960;&#8057;&#955;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8055;&#954;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 457]</span><span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span>.
The sight afforded by the towers in this steep height is, by him, compared with
that of the beacon at Alexandria from the sea (<i>B. J.</i> vi. c. 6: &quot;It resembled
in shape the lighthouse as seen by people sailing up to Alexandria&quot;). Compare the
similar representation of <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Lib.</i> 5. <i>Histor.</i> c. 11 (<i>Reland</i>
ii. p. 848 sqq.).</p>
<p class="normal">On the summit of this high and steep hill, in the upper town,
was situated the royal castle, called the &quot;upper house of the king,&quot; Neh. iii. 25.
Its situation could not fail to afford to it extraordinary security. This is sufficiently
shown by the ridicule of the Jebusites, when David, who did not build, but only
enlarged it, was about to besiege it. They were of opinion that the lame and the
blind would be sufficient for its defence, 2 Sam. v. 7-9; compare <i>Faber&#39;s Archæol.</i>
p. 191.</p>
<p class="normal">Far above this royal castle, which David first selected for his
residence (compare 2 Sam. v. 9: &quot;And David dwelt in the castle and called it the
City of David, and built it round about&quot;), a tower jutted prominently out, and afforded
a majestic sight. It is frequently mentioned in Scripture. The principal passage
is Neh. iii. 25: &quot;Opposite the tower which standeth out from the upper house of
the king (appositely the Vulgate: <i>quæ eminet de domo regis excelsa</i>) in the
court of the prison;&quot; compare ver. 26, where the tower standing out, and elevated
far above the king&#39;s castle, is likewise spoken of. Concerning the words, &quot;In the
court of the prison,&quot; we obtain some information from Jer. xxxii. 2: &quot;Jeremiah the
prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;
&#1492;&#1502;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492;</span>, which is in the house of the king of Judah;&quot; compare Jer. xxxviii.
6, according to which the pit into which the prophet was let down, was in the court
of the prison. According to these passages, the court of the prison formed, agreeably
to the customs of the East, part of the royal castle on Zion; and it was in this
court that the tower rose. The other principal passage is in the Song of Solomon
iv. 4: &quot;Thy neck is like the tower of David built for arms; a thousand bucklers
are hanging on it, all arms of heroes.&quot; According to this passage, the majestic
appearance which the tower afforded was still further increased by the glittering
arms which covered it. <i>Döpke</i> and others think of the armour of conquered
heroes; but that we must rather think of the armour of David&#39;s own heroes, appears
from Ezek. xxvii. 10, 11, where it is said of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 458]</span>
the hired troops of the Tyrians, &quot;Shield and helmet they hanged up in thee,&quot; and
is confirmed by the constant designation of David&#39;s faithful ones, as <i>his heroes</i>;
compare Song of Sol. iii. 7: &quot;Threescore heroes stand around the bed of the king,
of the heroes of Israel;&quot; and 1 Chron. xii. 1: &quot;These were among the heroes, helpers
in the war.&quot; The expression in the Song of Solomon iv. 4, &quot;All shields of the heroes,&quot;
indicates that the armour of all those who were received into the number of the
heroes, was hung up on that tower, as an outward sign of this reception, as a kind
of diploma of it. The circumstance that this tower, which is certainly quite identical
with the tower mentioned by Nehemiah, is called the tower of David, refutes the
supposition of <i>Clericus</i>, on Nehemiah, <i>l.c.</i>, according to which, it
is not the castle of David or Zion which is spoken of in that passage, but another
castle and its tower in the lower town, supposed to have been built by Solomon.
This hypothesis is refuted, moreover, by that passage itself, inasmuch as the castle
is there designated as the upper, or high one.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, it is this tower which Micah considers as the symbol of the
Davidic house; and in so doing, he follows the example of the Song of Solomon, where
it is the symbol of the lofty elevation of Israel, the centre and life-blood of
which was the Davidic family. It scarcely needs any lengthened demonstration to
show how well suited it was for this signification, how very naturally it represented
the thing signified. It was indeed the most elevated part of the castle, the main-mast,
as it were, of the ship, which, since the elevation of the Davidic family to the
royal dignity, had been for centuries, and was still to be, the seat of the Davidic
race. Its height was a symbol of the royal dignity and authority. Its relation to
the whole of the rest of the city, which it overlooked and commanded, and which
looked up to it with astonishment, symbolized the relation of the subjects to their
king.</p>
<p class="normal">Micah calls this tower the &quot;Tower of the flock.&quot; The main reason
for this appellation must be sought in what immediately precedes, in vers. 6 and
7. As in chap. ii. 12, 13, so here also, Micah represented the Covenant-people under
the figure of a flock that was to be gathered from its dispersion and estrangement,
and protected against every hostile attack. Could anything then be more natural
than that, continuing the image <span class="pagenum">[Pg 459]</span> which he had
begun, he should call the tower, which, to him, symbolized the family by whom, under
the guidance of the Lord, that gathering should be accomplished, the &quot;Tower of the
flock?&quot;<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_459a" href="#ftn_459a">[4]</a></sup>
It is just this close connection with what precedes which furnishes an important
proof for the correctness of our explanation, for which the way was prepared by
all those expositors who, like <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>Cyril</i>, <i>
Cocceius</i>, and <i>Paulus</i> (<i>über die Evang.</i> i. p. 189), understand
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;</span> as an appellative, and regard, as
the ground of the appellation, the protection and the refuge. In the East, they
look out from the towers of the flock, whether beasts of prey or hostile bands be
approaching. It is into these that the flocks are driven, in those regions where
there are no towns and villages, as soon as danger appears; compare the proofs in
<i>Faber</i>, l.c., p. 192 ff. There was so much the stronger reason for Micah&#39;s
choosing this figurative mode of representation, as he had the type immediately
before his eyes. According to 2 Chron. xxvi. 10, xxvii. 4, Uzziah and Jotham erected,
in the woods and pasture grounds, castles and towers for the protection and refuge
of the flocks. But, besides this main reason, there seems to have existed a secondary
one for choosing this appellation. They who adhere so firmly to the &quot;Tower of the
flock,&quot; mentioned in Genesis, are not altogether wrong. Except in that passage,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;</span> nowhere occurs in precisely the same
manner as it stands here. If, then, we consider that, besides this reference, there
occur in Micah other plain references to the Pentateuch (and very numerous they
are, compared with the extent of his prophecies; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, ii. 12, 13.
[vide supra], vi. 4, 5, vii. 14, where the words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1513;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1491;</span> receive light from Num. xxiii. 9 only<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_459b" href="#ftn_459b">[5]</a></sup>);
and still more, if we consider that, in v. 1 (2), the appellation Bethlehem Ephratah
is likewise taken from Gen. xxxv. 19, and that it is in ver. 21 of the same chapter
that the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; is mentioned,&mdash;we shall certainly not be guilty of
trifling, if we assert that there is a suspicion of error and unsoundness against
all those interpretations which cannot connect the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 460]</span> in Micah with that which is spoken of in Genesis.
But the explanation which we have given is not liable to this charge. For why should
not Jacob, and the tower which he built for the protection of his literal flocks,
serve the prophet as a type and substratum for the relation of a spiritual Shepherd?
We must not overlook the truth, that the main and secondary reasons which we have
adduced, do not stand beside each other, but run into each other,&mdash;are related to
each other as the general and particular. For the reason why the prophet had specially
in view the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; which had been built by Jacob was certainly this
only: that it partook of the nature of all such towers of the flocks. The <i>tertium
comparationis</i> is not thereby changed; the figure is only more individualized,
and, therefore, more striking and impressive. A reference to the pastoral life of
the Patriarchs is certainly one of the reasons of the frequent use of images taken
from pastoral life. In a different way, <i>Hitzig</i> endeavours to come to the
same result. He supposes that the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; mentioned in Genesis was
not situated in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, but is identical with the tower
of the castle on Zion, and of the castle of Millo which David already found existing,
and which was only more strongly fortified by him and by Solomon, 2 Sam. v. 9; 1
Kings ix. 15, 24, xi. 27. The figure of the &quot;Tower of the flock&quot; was so much the
more appropriate in the passage under consideration, as the founder of the royal
dynasty had been, for a long time, a shepherd of the lambs, before he was elected
to be a shepherd of the people, and had thus himself prefigured his future relation&mdash;a
circumstance to which allusion is frequently made in Scripture itself; compare 2
Sam. v. 2, vii. 8; 1 Chron. xi. 2; Ps. lxxviii. 70-72.</p>
<p class="normal">After having thus ascertained what is to be understood by the
&quot;Tower of the flock,&quot; there can be no great difficulty in explaining the &quot;hill of
the daughter of Zion.&quot; The daughter of Zion is Zion itself, personified, and represented
as a virgin; and if her hill be spoken of, what else can be meant, than Mount Zion
in the more restricted sense&mdash;the Mount <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>,
before which Akra and Moriah are changed into plains? We have thus a most appropriate
relation of the two appellations to each other,&mdash;the tower of the flock being the
particular, and the hill of the daughter of Zion, the general.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 461]</span> <i>Further</i>,&mdash;We obtain the most perfect
harmony and agreement with the last words of the verse. The hill which, morally
and physically, commands the daughter of Zion, is the same which obtains dominion
over the daughter of Jerusalem. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;We see the most striking contrast
with iii. 12, and the most admirable connection with iv. 1-7, in which, everywhere,
Mount Zion is spoken of, and the exaltation is described which, after its deep abasement,
it shall obtain in the future, by the flowing of the heathens to it, and by the
dominion of the Lord to be there exercised.</p>
<p class="normal">It is only in appearance that our explanation is contradicted
by passages of the Old Testament, and of <i>Josephus</i>, where <i>Ophel</i> is
mentioned as a particular place; compare <i>Bachiene</i> 2. 1, § 76; <i>Hamelsveld</i>
2, S. 35 ff. The supposition of several interpreters, that this <i>Ophel</i> is
some particular hill (compare, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Vitringa de Templo Ezech.</i> L.
i. c. iii. p. 159, and his <i>Commentary on Isaiah</i> xxxii. 13), has already been
invalidated by <i>Reland</i> (p. 855), and <i>Faber</i> l.c., p. 347, who rightly
remark, that <i>Josephus</i>, in enumerating the hills of Jerusalem, makes no mention
of <i>Ophel</i>, but speaks always only of the place <i>Ophel</i>. All the difficulties,
however, which stand in the way of the other assumptions, are removed by the following
view of the matter. Mount Zion was called <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;</span>,
the Hill <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>, and this word became,
by and by, a <i>nomen proprium</i>, and, in this state, as well as in its transition
to the <i>nomen proprium</i>, was used without the Article. From this it followed&mdash;and
numerous analogies everywhere occur&mdash;that the foot of the mountain, the place where
it was connected with the lower part of the temple-mountain by means of a deep valley,
acquired this name in preference, and received it, as it were, as a <i>nomen proprium</i>.
At this foot of Zion&mdash;and hence over against the temple, and near it&mdash;dwelt the Nethinim,
the temple servants, Neh. iii. 26; and <i>Josephus</i> says, that the wall surrounding
Mount Zion extended on the east side to the place which was called <i>Ophel</i>,
and ended at the eastern porch of the temple (<i>de Bell. Jud.</i> vi. 6).</p>
<p class="normal">The view which we have taken, not only of <i>Ophel</i>, but of
this whole passage, receives an important confirmation by Is. xxxii. 13, 14: &quot;Upon
the land of My people come up thorns and briars, for they shoot up in all the houses
of joy, in the joyous city. For palaces are forsaken, tumult of the city is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 462]</span> forsaken, <i>hill</i> and <i>tower</i> are
around caves (<i>i.e.</i>, it is only this which they have to protect) for ever,
a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks.&quot; In this threatening of punishment, <i>
hill</i>, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;</span>, and <i>tower</i>,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1495;&#1503;</span> (properly &quot;a watch-tower,&quot; corresponding
to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;</span>), are joined, just as in Micah&#39;s promise;
and this is a certain proof of the unsoundness of all those explanations which would
sever the two in Micah. Perhaps there is, in that passage of Isaiah, the addition
of a third object, standing in the middle between the two, viz., the castle of the
king which was situated on Zion, and of which the highest and strongest part was
formed by the tower. There seems, at least, to be better ground for understanding
this by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;</span> than the temple, as is done
by <i>Vitringa</i>. It will, nevertheless, be better to understand the palace collectively,
and to view it as being parallel to the houses of joy in ver. 13. So much is, at
all events, evident, that here also, <i>Ophel</i> cannot be understood of the lowest
part of Mount Zion, inasmuch as it had nothing distinguished about it that could
account for its being mentioned in this context; and to this, the circumstance of
its being connected with the tower, must, moreover, be added. <i>Faber</i>, l.c.,
has convincingly proved, that <i>Ophel</i>, in the stricter sense, neither had,
nor could have, any fortifications.</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;</span>, &quot;unto thee,&quot; seems
here to have that emphasis which originally belongs to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1491;</span>. It indicates that the object in motion
really reaches its goal, while <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;</span> originally
expresses only its direction towards the goal. It points to all the obstacles which
seem to render it impossible for the dominion to reach its goal, and represents
them as such as shall be overcome by divine omnipotence. This is quite in accordance
with the scope of the whole representation, which <i>Calvin</i> thus appositely
points out: &quot;The prophet endeavours to confirm the faith and hope of the godly,
that they might look forward to the distant future, and not dwell only upon the
present destruction; that they might rather believe that the matter was in the hands
of God, who had promised, that He who raised the dead, would also restore the kingdom
of David, which had been destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Several interpreters, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rosenmüller</i>, connect
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;</span> immediately with what follows: &quot;The kingdom
shall come and attain.&quot; But, in opposition to this, there are not only the <i>accents</i>
(<i>Michaelis</i>; &quot;The <i>Athnach</i> is intended to keep the mind
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 463]</span> of the reader in suspense for some time, and
to direct his attention to what follows&quot;), but also the change of the tenses, which
is intended just to prevent this connection, and the weak sense which would be the
result, inasmuch as one of the verbs would be a pleonasm. It must rather be supposed,
therefore, that the subject in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;</span> is indefinite.
The remark which <i>Hävernick</i>, in his <i>Commentary on Daniel</i>, S. 386, makes
on the omission of the indefinite subject, is here fully applicable, although he
himself makes a wrong application of it to that passage: &quot;The indefinite subject,&quot;
he says, &quot;has a special emphasis. By the omission of the definite idea, it is, as
it were, left to the reader to supply everything possible (in the passage under
consideration, the compass of all that is glorious), for which the writer cannot
find language.&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The &quot;first,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, former, or ancient &quot;dominion,&quot; refers
to the splendid times under David and Solomon; but, at the same time, it supposes
a period when the dominion is altogether taken away from the dynasty of David. Such
a period had already been announced by the prophet, in his first discourse, inasmuch
as it is implied in the carrying away of all Judah into captivity; and still more
distinctly in iii. 12, according to which, Zion, the seat of the Davidic dominion,
is to be ploughed as a field. This announcement, with the express mention of the
king, returns in ver. 9, and, contrasted with It, the announcement of the restoration
of the Davidic dominion in v. 1 (2).</p>
<p class="normal">The last words of the verse are, by many expositors (<i>Calvin</i>,
<i>Michaelis</i>, and <i>Rosenmüller</i>), translated thus: &quot;And the kingdom, I
say, shall belong to the daughter of Jerusalem;&quot; so that Jerusalem would here be,
not the <i>object</i>, but the <i>subject</i> of dominion. The sense, according
to this explanation, is best brought out by <i>Calvin</i>: &quot;The prophet here distinctly
mentions the daughter of Jerusalem, because the kingdom of Israel had obscured the
glory of the true kingdom. The prophet hence testifies, that God was not unmindful
of His promise, and would so arrange it that Jerusalem should recover its lost dignity,
and the whole people be gathered unto one body.&quot; But this explanation must be rejected
on philological grounds. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;</span> is <i>status
constr.</i>; the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;</span> serves, therefore, only
as a circumlocution of the genitive; and it is not admissible to supply the Verb
Substant. To this, moreover, there must be added the reference
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 464]</span> to what precedes. The dominion over the daughter
of Jerusalem is to come to the tower which commands the daughter of Zion, not, by
any means, to the daughter of Zion herself. The prophet makes Jerusalem to represent
the kingdom of God; and, in so doing, he probably has regard to the relation of
Zion and of the king&#39;s castle to the town, by which was symbolized the relation
which the Davidic dynasty occupied to the kingdom of God.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<h3>CHAP. IV. 9-14.</h3>
<p class="normal">At the close of the last chapter, the prophet had announced severe
judgments. In the verses immediately preceding, he had given glorious promises.
In that which follows, he now combines these two elements; and it is only in chap.
v. that the promise again appears, purely, and by itself. The judgments are thus
introduced into the middle of the proclamation of salvation, in order that the faithful
might thus be preserved from forming any vain hopes, which, if not confirmed by
the result, are apt to be exchanged for much deeper despondency. But this same circumstance
contained within it an indirect consolation; for it is certain that He who causes
future events to be foretold, overrules them also; and &quot;He who sends them, can also
turn them.&quot; For the greatest cause of our despondency under the cross is certainly
the doubt which we entertain as to whether it really comes from God. The prophet,
however, affords <i>direct</i> consolation also. Whensoever he speaks of any calamity,
he immediately subjoins the announcement of divine deliverance. The intimation of
the sufferings, in this section, differs essentially from the former ones. It is
not, like these, in a threatening, but in an affectionate character; indeed, in
vers. 11-13, the consolation preponderates even outwardly. From this, it is sufficiently
evident, that it must have a different destination. Whilst the threatening was intended
chiefly for the ungodly, it has, just as much as the preceding pure promise, the
truly godly members of the Theocracy also in view, and aims at strengthening them
in the manifold temptations into which they must fall, in consequence of the sufferings
which <span class="pagenum">[Pg 465]</span> always come upon them also at the same
time, on account of their outward, and therefore also their inward, connection with
the wicked.</p>
<p class="normal">A glance at the great catastrophes, which were to precede the
appearance of Christ, was here just in its proper place. In the preceding context,
the prophet had mentioned the restoration of the former dominion. Here, he describes
how the dominion is lost (&quot;There is no king in thee,&quot; ver. 9), and what shall happen
during the period of this loss. He then further details, in v. 1 (2) sq., in what
manner the dominion is to be restored.</p>
<p class="normal">It is a threefold suffering, joined with deliverance from it,
which presents itself to the prophet in his inward vision, and which he describes
accordingly. This is evident from the three-fold <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;</span>, compare vers. 9, 11, 14, which, each time, indicates when a new scene
presents itself to the prophet. This, further, appears from the different character
which each one bears. In the case of the announcement in vers. 9 and 10, viz., the
carrying away to Babylon, it is alone the Lord&#39;s hand which delivers His people.
In the calamity described in vers. 11-13, He grants to Israel courage in war, and
victory to his <i>arms</i>. The plans of the enemies to destroy Zion are frustrated,
while in the former calamity they succeeded. In ver. 14, Zion is anew represented
as sorely pressed by enemies, and captured by them. According to v. 1, which is
closely connected with what precedes, the deliverance is accomplished by the Messiah,
in whom the promise of the restoration of the dominion of the house of David over
the daughter of Zion is fulfilled.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal">Ver. 9. &quot;<i>Now why dost thou raise a cry? Is there no king in
thee, or is thy councillor gone? For pangs have seized thee as a woman in travail.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Zion, mourning at the time of the carrying away into captivity,
stands before the prophet&#39;s spirit, and is addressed by him. This ought never to
have been overlooked. But since, nevertheless, it has been so, we quote from the
multitude of analogous instances, at least one which is altogether incontrovertible,
and where the writer likewise transfers himself into the time of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 466]</span> captivity, viz., the passage in Hos. xiii.
9-11, which, in other respects also, shows a great resemblance to the one under
consideration: &quot;This has destroyed thee, O Israel, that thou wast against Me, against
thine help. Where is now thy king? Let him deliver thee in all thy cities. And where
are thy judges? Surely thou didst say: Give me kings and princes. And I gave thee
a king in Mine anger, and took him away in My wrath.&quot; It is quite impossible to
entertain, even for a moment, the thought that, in this passage, Hosea speaks of
the real past and present, inasmuch as he prophesied before the destruction of the
kingdom of the ten tribes. Micah opens his representation just with the moment that
Jerusalem is captured by the enemies; and he announces to her that her sufferings
are not yet at an end,&mdash;that she must wander into exile. The progress of the thought
in the verse under consideration is this:&mdash;The prophet sees Zion dissolved in grief
and lamentation. Full of sympathy, he asks of her the cause of this mourning,&mdash;whether,
it may be, it was caused by the loss of her king; and he himself answers this question
in the affirmative, because such a cause could alone account for such a grief. Now,
in order fully to realize the mourning of Zion over her king, we must bear in mind
that the visible head was a representative of the invisible one,&mdash;the mediator of
His mercies: that hence, his removal was a token of divine anger, and an extinction
of every hope of salvation. Every other king is, indeed, likewise an anointed of
the Lord; but the king of Israel was so in a totally different sense. How deeply,
from this point of view, the loss of the king was felt, at the time when that which
is here merely the <i>ideal</i> present became the <i>real</i> present, is seen
from Lam. iv. 20: &quot;The breath of our life, the anointed of the Lord, is taken a
prisoner in their pits, he of whom we said. Under his shadow we shall live among
the heathen.&quot; In Zech. iv. the civil magistrates, along with the ecclesiastical
authorities, appear as the greatest gift of God&#39;s grace; henceforth these two shall
again be the medium through which the Lord communicates His gracious gifts to the
Congregation, just as they had been before the captivity. It must further be borne
in mind, that all the promises for the future were bound up with the regal institution.
With its extinction, therefore, everything seemed to be lost; every prospect of
a better future seemed to have disappeared. The reference in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 467]</span> Jer. viii. 19, where the king is the Lord
Himself, to the passage before us, is very beautiful, and full of deep meaning.
It points out the truth, that the loss of the earthly king is a consequence of their
having forced the heavenly King to withdraw from the midst of them.&mdash;The &quot;councillor&quot;
is preeminently the king himself; compare Is. ix. 5, where Christ, in whom the Davidic
dynasty is to attain to the full height of its destination, appears as the councillor
in the highest sense. Other councillors, it is true, are not thereby excluded; they
form, however, only a group around the king as their centre; compare Is. iii. 3.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 10. &quot;<i>Travail and break forth, O daughter of Zion, like
a woman who bringeth forth; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou
dwellest in the field, and comest till to Babylon: there shalt thou be delivered,
there the Lord shall redeem thee out of the hand of thine enemies.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The consolation begins with the words
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501; &#1514;&#1504;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;</span> only; the whole remaining part of
the verse is of a mournful character. In the words, &quot;Travail and break forth,&quot; one
aspect only of the figure of the parturient woman is brought into view, viz., the
pain; but not the joy following upon the pain; compare remarks on v. 2. The Imperative
is thus not, as some interpreters erroneously assume, an <i>Imper. consolationis</i>,
but an intimation that the pain would reach its height, put into the form of an
exhortation to submit to it. Much more satisfactorily than by many of the later
expositors, the sense of this verse has been thus fixed by <i>Calvin</i>: &quot;The sum
and substance is, that although God would, according to His promise, take care of
the people, the faithful should have no reason from this to indulge in joy, as if
they were to be exempt from all troubles; on the contrary, the prophet exhorts them
that they should rather prepare themselves to undergo all kinds of misery, so that,
when driven out of their own land, they should not only, like straying people, wander
about in the fields, but should be driven to Babylon as into a grave. But while
he thus prepares the faithful to bear the cross, he subjoins the hope of salvation,
viz., that God would deliver them, and redeem them from thence out of the hands
of their enemies.&quot;&mdash;The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;</span> resumes the preceding,
where the prophet had, at the point of time where he had taken his stand, viz.,
the capture of the city, represented that calamity of this <span class="pagenum">
[Pg 468]</span> people, under the image of the pains of child-bearing. It thus becomes
equivalent to&mdash;Thou shalt be obliged to bear, not only the pains which precede the
birth, but also the highest of all pains, viz., the pains of the birth itself. What
the latter are in relation to the former, that, in the view of the prophet, is the
carrying away out of the Holy Land,&mdash;the expulsion from the face of God (an expulsion
similar to that of Cain when he was obliged to flee from Eden), when compared to
the mere capture. Hence the close connexion with what follows, by means of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span>. The word
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1497;</span> (the <i>o</i> is, for the sake of euphony,
employed instead of <i>u</i>; just as in ver. 13 <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1497;</span>) is, by most interpreters, translated, &quot;And lead out.&quot; But we must object
to this, on the ground that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1493;&#1495;</span> has always
an intransitive signification only, viz., &quot;to break forth;&quot; and this signification
is here quite suitable, more so even than the transitive; for it marks more emphatically
the <i>pain</i> during the birth, which is here the only point: Jer. iv. 31. It
is, as it were, a dissolution of the whole nature, a violent breaking of it into
pieces. The &quot;now,&quot; just as the &quot;now&quot; at the commencement of the description of the
scene, belongs to the <i>ideal</i> standing-point, where the carrying away is just
at hand; for this is the period of the future into which the prophet has been carried.
The &quot;dwelling in the field&quot; is the intervening station between the &quot;going forth&quot;
and &quot;the coming to Babylon.&quot; In the open air, exposed to all the inclemencies of
the weather (compare the expression, &quot;Under the dew of heaven,&quot; in Dan. iv. 22,
30 [25, 33]), the prisoners were collected for the purpose of being afterwards carried
away. The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1491;</span>, as well as the twofold
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1501;</span>, are emphatic. Irresistibly, the divine
<i>judgment</i> advances to its last goal; but as irresistibly does divine <i>mercy</i>
wrest from the enemies the prey which seemed to have been given to them even for
ever.&mdash;The futility of all attempts to explain away the distinct prophecy of the
Babylonish captivity in this passage has been shown in the <i>Dissertations on the
Genuineness of Daniel</i>, p. 151 sqq. How even <i>Caspari</i> could join in these
attempts, it is difficult to explain. Even he is of opinion that the prophet had
expected the catastrophe to come from Asshur. Chap. v. 4, 5 (5, 6) cannot be decisive
<i>for</i> the reference to Asshur. For the circumstance that Asshur appears there
as the type of the future enemies of the kingdom of God, implies, indeed, that he
occupied the first place among the enemies <span class="pagenum">[Pg 469]</span>
at the time of the prophet; but it by no means Implies that he must occupy a place
in the outline of the future catastrophes of the people of God. Such a catastrophe
was not to proceed from him, but rather from an enemy who had not yet at that time
appeared on the scene, although his power was already germinating, as is shown by
Is. xxxix. and other passages. The oppression of Judah by Asshur was indeed a heavy
one; but it was transitory, and did not by any means constitute an era. From the
relation in which vers. 9-14 (iv. 9-v. 1) stands to ver. 8, it sufficiently appears
that the oppression by the Chaldeans must here form the commencement, although the
Assyrian oppression must be added to it as an introduction and a prelude. According
to this relation, the point at issue here can be only the cessation of the dominion
of the Davidic family. From. Jer. xxvi. 18, 19, <i>Caspari</i> endeavours to prove
that Micah had in view, in the first instance, the Assyrians only. But that passage
of Jeremiah refers to Mic. iii. 12, where the prophecy has a general character,
and where the instruments of the divine judgment are not expressly mentioned, as
is the case here. On the other hand, the following arguments are opposed to the
reference to the Assyrians. 1. The prophet does not mention Asshur, but Babylon.
Nothing is, certainly, proved by the circumstance that, at the time of the prophet,
Babylon was still under the Assyrian dominion; for Babylon comes here into consideration,
not so much as a place, but as a hostile power. The place, as such, was of no consequence,
and the mention of it was not required by the character of the prophecy. 2. If the
announcement referred to Asshur, the result would contradict the prophecy. <i>Caspari</i>
says, that by the repentance and conversion of the people, the fulfilment had been
averted. But with such a view of prophecy, the position of the prophetic institution
becomes untenable, and historically incomprehensible. The Mosaic regulation, that
whosoever prophesied anything that did not take place should be punished with death,
would in that case lose all practical significance; for there would always have
been at hand the excuse, that by the repentance the execution of that sentence of
punishment had been repealed. From the nature of the case, and from that Mosaic
regulation, it follows that special announcements expressed absolutely must be fulfilled
absolutely; and not a single fact in the history of prophetism
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 470]</span> stands in contradiction to this truth. Jonah&#39;s
announcement to Nineveh, indeed, has been appealed to; but, in reply, we remark
simply, that the words of that announcement have not been communicated to us, while
we see from the result that it was conditional only. Such a decided repentance would
scarcely have been called forth by it among the inhabitants of Nineveh, had repentance
not been expressly declared in it as a means of deliverance. 3. Micah everywhere
goes hand in hand with his contemporary Isaiah. But the latter always opposes energetically
the despondency of Judah in the face of Asshur, and declares that his proud power
would be broken at Jerusalem (as had been already prophesied by Hosea in i. 4-7),
and that, while the kingdom of the ten tribes would be destroyed, Judah would experience
the protecting hand of the Lord. <i>Caspari</i> contradicts himself in thus making
these two men of God to differ in so essential a point. For a man like <i>Hitzig</i>,
it may be quite befitting to say, &quot;Micah did not possess the firm, courageous faith
which was displayed by Isaiah.&quot; 4. It is quite impossible to get rid of the obvious
parallelism of the passage under consideration with Is. xxxix. 6, 7, where the rising
of the Babylonish empire, the destruction of the Davidic kingdom by it, and the
carrying away of Judah to Babylon, are clearly and distinctly predicted. And in
a number of other prophecies, Isaiah likewise declares or supposes, that that which
the Assyrians threatened in vain, would at some future period, when the iniquity
of the people had become full, be carried out by Babylon with her Chaldeans. It
is scarcely conceivable how <i>Caspari</i>, acknowledging as he does the genuineness
of these prophecies of Isaiah, could think of dissevering from them the prophecy
now under consideration.&mdash;Declarations like that before us, where, in clear and distinct
outlines, a future event is foretold one hundred and fifty years before it takes
place, inflict a death-blow upon the naturalistic view of the prophetic institution,
as is sufficiently evident from <i>Hitzig&#39;s</i> embarrassment, and from his efforts
to free himself from the bands of this troublesome fact.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 11. &quot;<i>And now many nations assemble themselves against
thee, that say: Let her be profaned, and let our eyes look upon Zion.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">Israel, with its claim of being alone the people of the only true
God, was a thorn in the eyes of the nations. These here <span class="pagenum">[Pg
471]</span> burn with eager desire to prove, actually and by deeds, that this presumptuous
claim was unfounded, and, by the destruction of the city, to take from it its fancied
holiness, and the glory of holiness. Destruction and profanation are, in their view,
inseparably connected. The contrast to the verse under review is formed by vii.
10: &quot;And mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall come upon her who said. Where
is the Lord thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her, now shall she be trodden down as
the mire of the streets.&quot; The words, &quot;Where is the Lord thy God?&quot; entirely agree
in substance with, &quot;Let her be profaned!&quot; But the desire of profaning Jerusalem
must be conceived of as the human motive only. According to the view of Scripture
generally, and of Micah particularly, all the distress of the people of God has
its foundation in <i>sin</i>; and from the whole context, and especially from v.
2 (3), where this event also is comprehended within the time when God&#39;s people are
given up, it clearly appears that, notwithstanding the happy issue, we have here
before us a heavy calamity. By a new phase of sin, a new phase of judgment is brought
about; and by a new phase of worldliness, a new phase of aggression by the world&#39;s
power.&mdash;It is owing to a striving after variety, that the word &quot;and&quot; here stands
before &quot;now,&quot; while it is omitted in the third scene. It may stand, or it may be
omitted, because the various catastrophes are independent of each other, and yet,
at the same time, form a connected whole, as is evident from the words, &quot;He will
give them up,&quot; in v. 2 (3), by which they are connected together. The heavy oppression
of Judah appears here under the form of a siege of its centre, in accordance with
the scope of prophecy, which, everywhere, seeks to impart vividness and animation
to the scene, by uniting into one picture that which is separated by time and space.
The historical reference of the prophecy is thus very accurately stated by <i>Calvin</i>:
&quot;Although the Babylonish captivity has come to an end, and Israel has been restored
from it, the promised kingdom shall not immediately come. Before that takes place,
the neighbouring nations shall assemble themselves against Jerusalem, with the desire
of profaning it, and of enjoying a pleasant spectacle. This took place under Antiochus.&quot;
That to which the prophet here simply alludes, but yet in such a way that the right
reference cannot possibly be mistaken (since a great hostile aggression is here
described, which should happen <span class="pagenum">[Pg 472]</span> after the people
have returned from Babylon, and which is removed by the piety and courage of the
people themselves; and since, after this second oppression, there follows a third,
which is described in ver. 14, there certainly remains no other alternative: the
times of the Maccabees are those which can alone be thought of), is further detailed
by Zechariah in ix. 11 ff. At his time, the deliverance from the first calamity
had already taken place; and he expressly states the names of the enemies; just
as, in the prophecy under review, the authors of the first calamity are expressly
named. That which is especially characteristic, and which points to the time of
the Maccabees, is, moreover, the special mention of many nations, which are united
in their decided hatred against Jerusalem as a city, and against Judah as the people
of the Lord, taken in connection with the character of the war as a <i>religious
war</i> in the strictest sense,&mdash;it being an attempt of heathenism to destroy the
Congregation of the Lord as such. <i>These features are found in no other catastrophe
during the time between Micah and Christ.</i> And that the aggression belongs to
the period before the appearing of the Saviour, is evident from the whole context,
as well as from v. 2 (3). In the time of the Maccabees, it was not with Syria alone
that Judah had to do; but all the heathen nations without exception, with which
Judah had any connection at that time, united themselves for a decisive stroke against
the kingdom of God. Their purpose was to extirpate the whole race of Jacob, 1 Macc.
v. 2. Striking remarks upon the real nature of the struggle at that period, as a
struggle of faithful Judaism against Heathenism, the latter of which had gained
a considerable party among the people themselves, are made by Stark, in &quot;<i>Gaza
und die Philistäische Küste</i>,&quot; <i>Jena</i>, 52, S. 481 ff. Among other things,
he says: &quot;The national distinctions in the boundaries of Palestine had by no means
ceased, but continued under the general cover of the Egyptian and Syrian administration
in a varied, unyielding, and hostile manner. There were the Idumeans in the whole
of the south of Palestine to near Jerusalem; then, the Philistines, or when called
by their cities, the Gazeans and Ashdodians; the Ph&#339;nicians, the Samaritans or Chutteans,
the mixed population of Galilee, the Arabs of Perea.... As soon as the Jewish people,
who, up to that time, had been altogether insignificant in a political point of
view, rose against <span class="pagenum">[Pg 473]</span> the Syrian empire, at first
for their religious peculiarities, then, for their political independence, and,
finally, even for the recovery of the <i>ideal</i> possession of their country&mdash;an
idea which had been kept alive by tradition,&mdash;it could not but be that those who
were naturally the supports and centres of the Syrian operations, became the objects
of the hostile Jewish operations; and that the whole national portion of the population,
although not Greeks, were anew inflamed by their old hatred of, and opposition to,
Judaism; so that they considered that Hellenic struggle as also a national one.
This period thus produced at the same time a revival of the old national struggle
of the inhabitants of Palestine, modified and increased by the struggle of Hellenism
with the national reaction which served as a superstructure for it.&quot; The objection,
raised even by <i>Caspari</i>, that a prophecy of the victorious struggles in the
time of the Maccabees must be strange and surprising in a prophet of the Assyrian
period, will not startle those who look at the analogies&mdash;such as the prophecy in
Is. vi. In the latter prophecy, first the Chaldean, and then the Roman catastrophes,
are described in sharp outlines, but without any mention of the names of the instruments
of punishment. It is only in reference to the executors of the first of these judgments
that more distinct disclosures were given to the prophet himself at a subsequent
period. The announcement in Zech. ix., where the Greeks are expressly mentioned,
is, in reality, not less miraculous. According to all prophetical analogies, it
is <i>a priori</i> probable that this detailed prophecy of the Maccabean period,
and the similar one in Daniel, should have been preceded by some older prophecy
which refers to the same facts, but only in general outlines, such as we have in
the passage under consideration. If any doubt should still remain, it would be removed
by a glance at the conflicting interpretations. <i>Ewald</i> and <i>Hitzig</i> think
of the Assyrian invasion, to which vers. 9, 10, are likewise referred by them, although
such a reference is in opposition to the express words of these verses,&mdash;which, for
a Naturalistic tendency, are rather inconvenient. The contradiction in these two
prophecies <i>Ewald</i> endeavours to reconcile by the evidently erroneous supposition,
that the carrying away in ver. 10 must be conceived of as only a partial one,&mdash;a
supposition which is invalidated by a simple comparison of iii. 12. According to
<i>Hitzig</i>, the prophet has, in vers. 11-13, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</span>overcome
the despondency expressed in vers. 9, 10, and has raised himself to confidence in
God. He thus makes the prophet distinctly contradict himself in one breath,&mdash;a supposition
which does not even deserve a refutation. Even if we were entirely to separate this
passage from its connection, how ill does the activity here ascribed to Judah agree
with the oppression by the Assyrians! This activity of Judah supposes that it has
to do with many small nations. Against the great Asiatic empires, a direct and immediate
interposition of the Lord is <i>everywhere</i> referred to. The salvation, however,
which is here announced to Judah, can be only an imperfect one, and cannot go beyond
what they really received at the time of the Maccabees. This is sufficiently evident
from the circumstance, that it belongs to a time in which Judah has no king of the
Davidic house; for him they have already lost in ver. 9, and receive again only
in v. 1 (2), in Christ; and it is certain that the Davidic house was the channel
through which all the true and great mercies of the Lord were bestowed upon His
people.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 12. &quot;<i>And they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither
understand they His counsel; for He gathereth them as the sheaf for the threshing-floor.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The particle &quot;and&quot; is here used, where we, for the sake of a closer
connection, would employ &quot;but.&quot; The thoughts of the Lord are these,&mdash;that the sufferings,
after having served their purpose as regards Zion, shall pass over to the enemies,
so that they shall themselves be destroyed by Zion, while they so confidently thought
to inflict destruction upon Zion. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1497;</span> introduces
the reason of their not knowing the way of the Lord. If they knew it, they would
not express such desire and hope; <i>for it is they themselves</i> whom the Lord
gives over to destruction.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 13. &quot;<i>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I make
thine horn iron, and thy claws brass; and thou crushest in pieces many people, and
I consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their strength to the Ruler of the whole
earth.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The figure is based upon the Eastern mode of threshing; compare
<i>Paulsen vom Ackerbau der Morgenl.</i> § 40-42; <i>Niebuhr</i>, <i>Reise</i> i.
S. 151; and likewise Is. xxi. 10, xli. 15; Hab. iii. 12. Strictly speaking, one
characteristic only of the threshing oxen is here considered, viz., the crushing
power of their hoofs. The prophet, however, extends the comparison to that also
in which <span class="pagenum">[Pg 475]</span> the bullock is formidable, even when
it is not engaged in the work of threshing, viz., to its horns. On this point 1
Kings xxii. 11 may be compared, where the pseudo-prophet Zedekiah makes to himself
iron horns, and thus states the import of this symbolical action: &quot;Thus saith the
Lord, With these shalt thou push Aram until it is destroyed.&quot; The first person in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;</span> has perplexed several ancient translators
(<i>Syr.</i>, <i>Jerome</i>), as well as many modern interpreters, who, therefore,
substitute the second person for it. But it is quite appropriate. As at the beginning,
where the Lord gathers the sheaf on the threshing-floor, so at the close also, the
prophet declares that the victory is the work of God. It is He Himself, the true
God, the Lord of the whole earth, who reminds His rebellious subjects of their true
relation to Him, by vindicating to Himself a part of the good things which He bestowed
upon them; just as He once did in Egypt. This thought contains the reason why, instead
of the pronoun of the first person, the noun is employed; so that it is equivalent
to: To Me the only God, the Lord of the whole earth. But it is altogether distorted,
if the first person here be changed into the second. With respect to the import
of the word, we must by no means think only of the gifts of consecration which were
brought to the temple. Such a view would be necessary, only if the goods of the
Covenant-people, or the Covenant-people themselves, were introduced as that which
is to be consecrated. In that case we could understand, by that which is consecrated,
that only which is the exclusive property of the Lord, which has been dedicated
to Him exclusively, and for ever withdrawn from the use of His subjects, and which,
as far as they are concerned, is as good as annihilated; compare Lev. xxvii. 28:
&quot;Everything consecrated, which any one consecrates to the Lord, of man and of beast,
and of the field of his possession, shall not be sold nor redeemed; every consecrated
thing is most holy to the Lord.&quot; But here, where He who consecrates is the Lord,
while the goods are those of the heathen, the latter only are to be considered as
being excluded from the possession, and as those in reference to whom the goods
are consecrated goods; while the people of God must, on the other hand, be considered
as partaking in what He has acquired. The community of goods between these two is
rendered prominent in other passages also where the object required it. Thus, <i>
e.g.</i>, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 476]</span> Joel iv. (iii.) 5, where the Ph&#339;nicians
and Philistines are charged: &quot;My silver and My gold ye have taken, and My precious
things, the goodly ones, ye have carried into your palaces.&quot; That we cannot here
think of the temple-treasure is evident, not only from a comparison of ver. 4, where
the attempts of these nations to avenge themselves on Israel on account of former
injuries, are expressly represented as attempts to take vengeance upon God, but
also from history, which knows nothing of the plunder of the temple by Ph&#339;nicians
and Philistines. The mention of the <i>gain</i> points to the <i>male parta</i>,&mdash;and
this is the more strictly applicable, the nearer the relation is in which he who
is robbed stands to the Lord of the earth. With the <i>gain</i>, the substance in
general is lost.&mdash;The fundamental thought of the verse, which is here expressed only
with an application to a special case, is that of the victory of the Congregation
of the Lord over the world. This was perceived by <i>Calvin</i>, who strikingly
demonstrates how this declaration is ever anew realized, and how its complete fulfilment
is reserved only for the second coming of Christ. He has erred, however, in this,
that looking only to the eternal import of the thought, he overlooked the circumstance
that it is here expressed with reference to a definite event in which it was to
be realized.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 14. &quot;<i>Who thou gatherest thyself in troops, O daughter
of troops. They lay siege against us, they smite the judge of Israel with the rod
upon the cheek.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">A new scene presents itself to the prophet. Zion, victorious on
the preceding occasion, appears here as powerless, and locked up within her walls.
She is captured; and ignominious abuse is cast upon the leaders of the deeply abased
people.&mdash;We need not here dwell for any length of time upon the numerous expositions
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1514;&#1490;&#1491;&#1491;&#1497;</span>. There is only one, viz., &quot;thou
shalt press thyself together,&quot; which affords an appropriate contrast; while this
contrast is lost when it is translated, as <i>Hofmann</i> does, by: &quot;thou shalt
lacerate thyself&quot; (compare what <i>Caspari</i> has advanced against it). &quot;Thou shalt
press thyself together&quot; does not, moreover, destroy the import of Hithpael, and
has especially the use of the Hithp. of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1491;&#1491;</span>,
in Jer. v. 7, in its favour. The Hithpael in this signification is probably a Denominative
of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;</span>. The person addressed, the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;</span>, can be none other than the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;</span> in ver. 13. For it is she who is addressed
by the prophet <span class="pagenum">[Pg 477]</span> in each of the new scenes announced
by <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;</span>, and she is, generally, the only one
to whom the discourse is, throughout the whole section, addressed. The intentional
paronomasia occasioned by the designation &quot;daughter of troops,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, who
appeared in warlike array, evidently alludes to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;</span>,
and refers to the description of Zion as a brave victorious hero, in the preceding
verses. The <i>enemy</i> is immediately afterwards spoken of in the third person.
The words, &quot;Siege (not by any means &#39;a wall,&#39; as <i>De Wette</i> maintains) they
lay, or direct against us,&quot; clearly indicate that the pressing of themselves together,
which forms a contrast with the former courageous excursions indicated by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;</span>, is the consequence of fear, weakness,
and hostile oppression. The words are therefore strikingly paraphrased by <i>Justi</i>,
thus: &quot;But now, why dost thou thus press thyself together, thou who wast accustomed
to press others?&quot; This, however, only must be kept in mind, that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;</span> implies an allusion to the fact that
the warlike disposition continues even in the present, notwithstanding the feebleness
forced upon her,&mdash;a very characteristic feature. In saying, &quot;They lay siege against
<i>us</i>,&quot; instead of &quot;against <i>thee</i>,&quot; the prophet is carried away by his
emotions to show himself as one of the people whom he sees to be oppressed by so
heavy sufferings. As indicated by the word &quot;now&quot; also, he is, in spirit, in the
midst of them. The ignominious treatment of the judge of Israel supposes that the
prophet sees, in his inward vision, the capture of the city as having already taken
place; for it is impossible to conceive of the judge, the soul of the city, as being
outside of it. This judge of Israel is an <i>ideal</i> person, formed by the prophet
in order that he might be able to contrast him with the Ruler of Israel in v. 1
(2), who represents all the theocratic authorities; compare, <i>e.g.</i>. Is. iii.
12, where the corrupted leaders of the Theocracy present themselves to the prophet
in the person of a large child. To speak, in such a case, of a collective noun,
as is usually done, is out of place. But it may be observed that it is not a king
who is here spoken of, but, very significantly, a judge of Israel only, probably
with reference to the times before Saul, when Israel was governed by judges. The
royal dominion which, according to the announcement in ver. 9, shall be destroyed
by Babylon, shall be restored by the Messiah only (compare v. 1 [2], iv. 8), who
is not <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1508;&#1496; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>, but, like His great ancestor
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 478]</span> David, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1500;
&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>; compare 2 Sam. xxiii. 3. There can be no doubt that, in this connection,
the <i>Judge</i> is spoken of as distinguished from, and contrasted with, the <i>
King</i>. But even by itself, the mention of the <i>Judge</i> cannot but be startling.
It would have been against the object of the prophet to have mentioned any inferior
persons, when there existed a superior one; and if the <i>King</i> was thereby denoted,
why should he have been designated thus?&mdash;It is on purpose that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>, which is the <i>nomen dignitatis</i>
of the people, is here chosen. It more emphatically points out the unworthiness
of the treatment, as well as the contrast between the reality and the idea in the
destinies of the nation,&mdash;a contrast, it is true, which Israel has called forth by
the preceding contrast between the reality and the idea with regard to his conduct.
Since Israel has inwardly profaned himself by his own guilt, he is now, as a just
punishment, profaned outwardly also.&mdash;With respect, now, to the historical reference
of this disastrous announcement, its fulfilment cannot be sought for in any other
event than the invasion by the Romans. Among the sufferings of the people, which
are here described in general outlines, this is the only one recorded in history,
with the exception of those already mentioned. Isaiah, the contemporary of Micah,
likewise announced, as early as in chap. vi., that upon those who should return
from the captivity a second judgment would be inflicted, by which the national independence
should be destroyed. This judgment is described with remarkable clearness and distinctness
by the post-exilic prophets, inasmuch as, to them, it appeared already more in the
foreground; compare the remarks on Zech. v. and xi.; Dan. ix. The only plausible
argument against this reference is this,&mdash;that the capture of the city by the Romans
was subsequent to the appearance of the Messiah, and that it is, after all, the
latter which forms the subject of the announcement of salvation in v. 1 (2), which,
again, refers to the sufferings described in the verse before us. This argument,
however, is set aside by the following considerations. 1. The prophet, indeed, designates
the misery which was inflicted by those enemies upon the Covenant-people only according
to its acme, viz., the siege and capture of the city; but he, nevertheless, views
it in, and understands it of, its whole extent, and from its first beginnings. These,
then, in so far as the Romans are concerned, fall in the time before Christ, for
the Jewish <span class="pagenum">[Pg 479]</span> people were already subjected to
the Roman dominion by Pompey. 2. This alone, however, is not sufficient. If, with
<i>Vershuir</i> (<i>de celebri oraculo Mic.</i> iv. 14, in the <i>Dissert. Philol.
exeg.</i> Leuw. 1775), we confine ourselves to the capture by Pompey, we cannot,
by any means, get rid of the feeling that that fulfilment does not exhaust the prophecy.
But we are, on the other hand, quite entitled to add that highest point, viz., the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, along with all its still existing consequences,
if only we consider, that the announcement of salvation in chap. v.&mdash;as is shown
by its contents, and by its accordance with the analogy of all the Messianic prophecies&mdash;is
not limited to the short period of the first appearance of Christ. That comes into
consideration rather as the grain of seed only from which the tree grew up, under
which all the fowls of heaven were to dwell. Hence it is, that the salvation, no
less than the punishment, is a continuous one, until, at the end of the days, it
appears in its glorious consummation. But if it be established that Christ is presented
as the only Saviour from the calamity here described, then that calamity must still
continue for those who reject Him, yea, it must still be increased. It is only by
giving up their opposition that they can be delivered from the yoke which presses
upon them. The election, on the other hand, is, from the very beginning, received
into the communion of His kingdom, which extends over the whole world. Here, however,
that which has been already remarked in reference to vers. 11-13 finds its application.
The siege and capture of Zion are pre-eminently the means of representing the idea
of the heavy oppression and deep abasement of Israel, and of the cessation of its
political independence, although it must not upon any account be overlooked, that
the natural form of the representation is, at the same time, the natural form of
the realization of the idea that Judah could not be destroyed without the siege
and capture of Jerusalem, its centre.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, too little to be among the thousands
of Judah, out of thee shall come forth unto Me</i> (one) <span class="pagenum">[Pg
480]</span> <i>to be Ruler in Israel; and His goings forth are the times of old,
the days of eternity.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The close connection of this verse with what immediately precedes
(<i>Caspari</i> is wrong in considering iv. 9-14 as an episode) is evident, not
only from the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;</span> copulative, and from the analogy
of the near relation of the announcement of salvation to the prophecy of disaster
in the preceding verse (for if the connection with ver. 14 be overlooked, the announcement
of disaster contained in it remains without a corresponding consolation,&mdash;and this
would be against the analogy of vers. 9, 10, 11-13); but more strikingly so from
the contrast of the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1500;</span> with the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1508;&#1496; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>. The <i>Judge</i> of Israel in his
deepest abasement, is here contrasted with the <i>Ruler</i> of Israel in His highest
divine glory. The connection is seen also in the indication of Bethlehem&#39;s natural
littleness, as contrasted with the greatness to be bestowed upon it by God. What
could have induced the prophet thus strongly to point out this circumstance, had
it not been that he considered Bethlehem as the type of the Jewish people in their
misery, described in the preceding verse, and the miraculous elevation of the former,
to be accomplished by divine omnipotence, as the pledge of a like result for the
whole people? There is, moreover, a reference to the <i>beginning</i> of the pretended
episode. In iv. 9, it was said: &quot;There is no king in thee;&quot; here, it is announced
that from Bethlehem there comes forth a glorious Ruler in Israel. But, on the other
hand, there is also a close connection with ver. 8, as has been rightly perceived
by Caspari. This connection and reference are sufficiently indicated by the like
form. The address to Bethlehem here corresponds with the address to &quot;the Tower of
the flock&quot; there,&mdash;the &quot;Ruler,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1500;</span>, here,
with the &quot;dominion,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1492;</span>, there. There,
the dominion returns to the house of David; here, the august person is described
by whom this return is effected, after the events, described iv. 9-14, have come
upon the Covenant-people. That the Ruler here comes forth out of Bethlehem, corresponds
with iv. 8 in so far as there the dominion <i>returns</i> to the Tower of the flock,
to the hill of the daughter of Zion, which implies the overthrow of the Davidic
kingdom, and the return of the family of David to the condition in which it lived
at Bethlehem before the time of David,&mdash;which must necessarily precede its final
glory.&mdash;According to <i>Bachiene</i> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 481]</span> ii. 2,
S. 7 ff., Bethlehem and Ephratah are to be distinguished, so that the former designates
the town alone, and the latter at the same time its whole environs,&mdash;so that Bethlehem
Ephratah would be equivalent to Bethlehem situated in Ephratah. But even if we were
to agree with this opinion, we must not, by any means, consider the two words as
standing in the <i>stat. constr.</i>, any more than the corresponding
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;</span> in Judges xvii. 9, xix. 1, 2,
18. For as a <i>Nomen proprium</i> is equivalent to a noun with the article, it
can never stand in the <i>stat. constr.</i> with another noun. We should thus be
obliged to assume that, by way of brevity, common in geographical designations,
both appellations were placed unconnectedly beside each other, without any indication
of their relation, just as in addressing a letter, we would simply write Berlin,
Prussia. But if we compare Gen. xxxv. 19, where Ephratah is simply declared to be
identical with Bethlehem (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;</span>);&mdash;and
if we consider that the prophet had already alluded to the contents of that chapter
(compare remarks on iv. 8), and that he regards the events which formerly happened
in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem as a type of those which were to take place in
future;&mdash;that in ver. 2 (3) he brings the new birth which is there to happen in parallelism
with one which had formerly occurred in its nearest neighbourhood, and that it is
just in the account of the latter that the designation occurs,&mdash;we shall have the
strongest reason for understanding here also the two names as a designation of the
town, without deciding whether the above-mentioned difference, as regards other
passages, be well founded or not. Interpreters commonly assert that the sole ground
of the twofold designation of the place is the intention of distinguishing it from
another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun; compare Josh. xix. 15. But in that case,
we should rather have expected the common Bethlehem Judah, instead of Bethlehem
Ephratah. There can be no doubt, that the prophet, in choosing this designation,
was guided by a regard to that passage in Genesis. One might also suppose that the
prophet wished to allude, at the same time, to the appellative significations of
these nouns, viz., &quot;house of bread,&quot; and &quot;field of fruit,&quot; and to lay stress upon
their typical import: the place, the blessing of which, as regards temporal things,
is indicated by its name, shall, at some <span class="pagenum">[Pg 482]</span> future
time, be blessed and fruitful in a higher sense. It is just in Micah, who is fond
of making significant allusions to names, that such a supposition is very natural,
as is shown, not only by chap. i., but also by vii. 18, where he gives an interpretation
of his own name. As, however, the two names elsewhere also occur thus connected,
without any attention being given to their signification, the prophet would not
have omitted giving a hint upon this point. It is not the way of Scripture to make
any allusions which cannot be understood with certainty. We shall, therefore, be
obliged to suppose that, after the common name, the prophet mentions, in addition,
the ancient name rendered sacred by memory from the time of the Patriarch, and by
the authority of the most ancient documents of revelation (compare, besides Gen.
xxxv. 19, Gen. xlviii. 7), in order thereby to impart greater solemnity to the discourse,
and to intimate what great things he had to say of Bethlehem. In accordance with
this designation by two names, is, then, the circumstance that the address is directed
to Bethlehem.&mdash;The word <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;</span> forms an apposition
to Bethlehem: &quot;little to be,&quot; instead of, &quot;who art too little to be.&quot; If the sense
were to be, &quot;thou art little,&quot; the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;</span> would
not have been omitted after <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;</span>. The circumstance
that Bethlehem is addressed as a masculine (comp. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; ,&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;</span>, and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1502;&#1498;</span>) may be accounted
for by the prophet&#39;s viewing the town in the image of its <i>ideal</i> representative;
compare remarks on Zech. ix. 7. In such a case, the gender may be neglected; compare,
<i>e.g.</i>, Gen. iv. 7, where sin, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;</span>,
appears as a masculine noun, on account of the image of a ravenous beast. Such personifications
occur very frequently. Thus, nothing is more common in the Mosaic law than that
Israel is addressed as one man. This has been frequently misunderstood, and, in
consequence, that which refers to the whole people has been applied to the single
individual. Thus it is even in the Decalogue. In Is. v. 7, the people of Judah appear
as the <i>man</i> Judah.</p>
<p class="normal">The <i>littleness</i> of Bethlehem is sufficiently evident from
the circumstance of its being left out in the catalogue of the towns of the tribe
of Judah, in Joshua (compare <i>Bachiene</i>, § 192). This induced the LXX. to insert
it in Josh. xv. 60 along with several other towns which had been omitted; and, in
doing so, they were probably guided, not so much by a regard to its outward
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 483]</span> importance, as by the interest which attached
to it from the recollection of an event of former times (compare Gen. xxxv.), from
its being the birth-place of David, and still more, from the prophecy under consideration,
by which the eyes of the whole nation were directed to this place, outwardly so
unimportant. The assertion of <i>Jerome</i>, that the Jews omitted the name in the
Hebrew text, in order that Christ might not appear as a descendant of the tribe
of Judah, has received from <i>Reland</i> (S. 643) a more thorough refutation than
it deserved. <i>Keil</i>, in his commentary on Joshua, has lately renewed the attempt
to prove, from internal reasons, the genuineness of the addition; but, from the
whole condition of the Alex. Version, it is very dangerous to trust to such arguments.
The very reasons which <i>Keil</i> brings forward in support of the addition, are
just those which might have induced the LXX. to make it. The circumstance that they
added to Bethlehem the name Ephratah, plainly indicates the reason which induced
them to introduce Bethlehem specially. Bethlehem is likewise omitted in the catalogue
of the towns of Judah, in Neh. xi. 25 ff., and can therefore have occupied among
them a very low place only, although it is mentioned in Ezra ii. 21, Neh. vii. 26.
In the New Testament, it is called a mere village (<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#8061;&#956;&#951;</span>,
John vii. 42). <i>Josephus</i>, indeed, occasionally gives it the title of a town
(compare Luke ii. 4, 11); but, in other passages, he designates it by
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>Ant.</i> v. 2, 8.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;
&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;</span> means properly, &quot;little in reference to being,&quot; instead of, &quot;too little
to be,&quot;&mdash;the wider expression being used to indicate the relations of the town to
the being, where we use the more limited expression.&mdash;Instead of the &quot;thousands of
Judah,&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;</span> ought to have been employed,
as it appears, in order strictly to maintain the personification. The representative
of Bethlehem is too small to be numbered among the heads of Judah. Several expositors
(<i>J. D. Michaelis</i>, <i>Justi</i>) have thereby been induced to point
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1467;&#1508;&#1461;&#1497;</span> instead of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1461;&#1497;</span>. But this supposed emendation is
set aside by the consideration that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</span>
is only the special designation of the Edomitish princes, and occurs in a general
sense, only by way of <i>Catachresis</i>, in Zechariah, who lived at a time when
the Hebrew language was nearly extinct. The most simple explanation is, that the
prophet views the thousands, or the families of Judah, no less than the town Bethlehem,
as <i>ideal</i> existences; in which <span class="pagenum">[Pg 484]</span> case,
the personification is maintained throughout. Moreover, there would not be any insurmountable
difficulty in the way of supposing that the prophet had given up the personification;
for these are frequently not strictly adhered to by the prophets, who constantly
pass from the figure to the thing prefigured. This may be at once seen from the
preceding verse, in the first clause of which, Zion appears personified as a woman,
while immediately afterwards there follows, &quot;against us.&quot;&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;</span>,
&quot;thousand,&quot; is frequently used for designating a family, because the number of its
members usually consisted of about a thousand; compare Num. i. 16, where it is said
of the twelve princes of the tribes: &quot;Heads of the thousands of Israel are they;&quot;
Num. x. 4; Josh. xxii. 14, 21; Judg. vi. 15; 1 Sam. x. 19. On the division of Israel
into thousands, hundreds, etc.&mdash;a division which existed before the time of Moses&mdash;compare
what has been advanced in my Dissertations on the <i>Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>,
ii. p. 341 sqq. It is self-evident that the thought here is, that Bethlehem is too
little to constitute a thousand <i>by itself</i>. Communities, however, which were
not sufficiently numerous to constitute, by themselves, a generation or family,
were reckoned with others, and formed with them an artificial generation, an artificial
family; for the divisions of generations and families were, owing to the great significance
which numbers had in ancient times, connected with numerical relations. An instance
of this kind occurs in 1 Chron. xxiii. 11, 12, where it is said of four brothers
that they had not sons enough, and were, for that reason, reckoned as one family
only. Being merely <i>part</i> of a generation, Bethlehem had no place among the
generations. The sense is clearly this: Bethlehem occupies a very low rank among
the towns of the Covenant-people,&mdash;can scarcely show herself in the company of her
distinguished sisters, who proudly look down upon her.&mdash;It is altogether a matter
of course that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</span>, &quot;to go out,&quot; may be
used also of &quot;being born,&quot; of &quot;descent,&quot; inasmuch as this belongs to the general
category of going out; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, 2 Kings xx. 18. We must, however, confine
ourselves to the general idea of &quot;going forth,&quot; &quot;proceeding,&quot; and not consider Bethlehem
as the father of the Messiah. In opposition to <i>Hofmann</i>, this is proved by
<i>Caspari</i>, from Jer. xxx. 21: &quot;And their governor shall proceed from the midst
of them;&quot; and from Zech. x. 4.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 485]</span>&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</span>
is without a definite subject. It is best to supply &quot;one,&quot; which is evidently implied
in what follows. The construction, which might otherwise appear somewhat strange,
has been occasioned by the desire of making perceptible, by the very words, and
their position, the contrast between the divine greatness and the natural littleness
of Bethlehem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="continue">Thou art little to be among the thousands of Judah;&mdash;<br>
	From thee shall come forth unto me, to be a Ruler in Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continue">From a place which is too little to form a single independent
member of the body, the head proceeds. From this contrast appears also the reason
why it is said, &quot;Ruler in Israel,&quot; while we should have expected to hear of the
Ruler of Israel <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>,&mdash;a circumstance
on which <i>Paulus</i> lays so much stress in opposing the Messianic interpretation.&mdash;Had
the prophet adopted the latter expression, not only would this contrast have been
less striking, but the other also, which is likewise intended, viz., the contrast
with the Judge of Israel, in the preceding verse, who loses his dignity. The prophet
was, in the first instance, concerned more about the <i>genus</i> than the <i>individual</i>,&mdash;more
about the idea of dominion in general, than about the mode and kind of it. The individual
is, afterwards, however, partly in this verse itself, partly in the following verse,
so distinctly characterized, that he cannot be by any means mistaken. Nothing more,
it is true, is implied in these words, than that, at some future time, there would
come forth from Bethlehem a Ruler over all Israel; and if these words stood isolated,
and if it could be proved that, after the time of Micah, there came forth from Bethlehem
a Ruler over all Israel, besides the Messiah&mdash;a thing which, however, cannot be proved&mdash;then,
indeed, it might be questionable which of the two to choose. <i>Caspari&#39;s</i> exposition,
&quot;Will <i>he</i> come forth,&quot; has this against it, that, in the preceding verses,
the Messiah was not yet spoken of, and, hence, that He cannot simply be supposed
as known; and least of all&mdash;if the acquaintance with Him were to be supposed from
other passages&mdash;could He have been introduced with a simple unaccented <i>he</i>:
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;</span> could not have been omitted in this
case. The case in iv. 8 is but little analogous, for the subject in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1514;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;</span> is there an indefinite one.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1497;</span>
is, by several interpreters, referred to the prophet. Thus <i>Rosenmüller</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</span> following <i>Michaelis</i>, says, &quot;<i>To me</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, for my good, the prophet says, in the name of his whole people.&quot; But
the reference to God is required by the contrast between human littleness and divine
greatness. <i>Calvin</i> remarks on it: &quot;By this word, God declares that His decree
to give up the people was not such, that Tie should not be willing to restore them
after some time. He therefore calls the faithful back to Himself, and reminds them
of His counsel, just as if He said, &#39;I have indeed rejected you for a time, but
not so as that I am not filled with compassion for you.&#39;&quot; The import of the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1497;</span>, viz., that God could exalt that which
was low, the believer saw, in a type, in David; and there is no doubt that the prophet
was anxious indirectly to refer them to this type, and thereby to strengthen their
faith in the promise, which appeared almost incredible. He (David) had been a native
of the humble, little Bethlehem, the youngest among his brothers, without power,
without renown. In order that the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1497;</span> might
become the more evident, the Lord, at his election, gave such a direction to the
circumstances, that this, his natural lowliness, might be most strikingly exhibited.
It was God who raised him from being a shepherd of lambs, to be a shepherd of nations.</p>
<p class="normal">In contrast with the Messiah&#39;s human and lowly origin. His divine
and lofty dignity is prominently brought out in the last words of the verse,&mdash;a contrast
similar to that in the case of Bethlehem, to which the prophet thereby refers. Here
also, the prophet has so clearly expressed the contrast by the words themselves,
that, upon the <i>homines bonæ voluntatis</i> among the interpreters of all ages,
it has most forcibly impressed itself. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Chrysostom</i>, <i>
demonstratio adv. Judæos et Gentiles, quod Christus sit Deus</i>, opp. T. V., p.
739: &quot;He exhibits both Godhead and manhood. For in the words, &#39;His goings forth
are from the beginning, from the days of eternity,&#39; His existence from all eternity
is revealed; while in the words, &#39;Shall come forth the ruler who feeds My people
Israel,&#39; His origin according to the flesh is revealed.&quot; A more minute inquiry into
the meaning of these words must begin with the investigation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span>. The greater number of interpreters
agree in this, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;</span>, the feminine form
of the more common <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;</span> here denotes the action
of the going forth. But this is opposed by the following considerations. 1. The
use of the plural. Those especially <span class="pagenum">[Pg 487]</span> who here
think of the eternal going forth of the Son from the Father, cannot by any means
justify it. Several among them consider it as <i>plur. majest.</i> Thus, <i>e.g.</i>,
do <i>Tarnovius</i> and <i>Frischmuth</i>, in the <i>Dissert. de Nativitate Messiæ</i>,
in the remarks on this passage, Jena 1661. But although such a plural exists, indeed,
in Hebrew, and many traces of it are to be found (compare my <i>Dissertations on
the Genuineness of the Pentateuch</i>, i. p. 267 ff.), it could appear here, of
course, in the suffix only, not in the noun. Others suppose that the plural stands
here simply for the singular. Now, there are, it is true, three cases in which such
does apparently take place:&mdash;the first, when a definite individual out of the multitude
is meant,&mdash;when accordingly, not the <i>number</i>, but the general idea only is
concerned;&mdash;the second, when a noun in the plural gradually loses its plural signification,
because the etymology and original signification have become indistinct;&mdash;the third,
when the plural stands for the abstract. Not one of these cases, however, is applicable
here. Those interpreters have most plausibly removed the difficulty who understand
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span> to be really a repeated act of going
forth, and refer it to the Old Testament doctrine of the Angel of the Lord. Thus
<i>Jerome</i>: &quot;Because He had always spoken to them through the prophets, and became
in their hands the Word of God.&quot; <i>Tremellius</i> and <i>Junius</i>: &quot;The goings
forth, <i>i.e.</i>, the declarations and demonstrations of, as it were, a rising
sun; He from the very beginning revealed and manifested Himself to all created things,
by the light of His word, and the excellency of His works;<!--1854 ed insert-->
just as the rising sun manifests himself from the moment of his rising, by the light
and its effects.&quot; <i>Cocceius</i>: &quot;I cannot, however, be persuaded to believe that
the plural <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span> is here used without emphasis.
For the Son has not gone forth from the Father, like a man from a man, who begins
to exist only when he is brought forth from a man, and when he goes forth, ceases
to be brought forth and to go out. In all the days of eternity, the Son proceeds
from the Father, and is the eternal <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#8059;&#947;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#948;&#8057;&#958;&#951;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span>.&quot; But this circumstance is, in general, against this explanation,
that the contrast with the going forth from Bethlehem, which is completed in one
act, does not admit of the mention of a manifold going forth, and that, in this
contrast, the arising, the origin of the existence of the Messiah, can alone be
thought of; while, more specially, <i>Jerome</i>, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 488]</span>
<i>Tremellius</i>, and <i>Junius</i>, who, with <i>Piscator</i> also, limit the
going forth to the relation to created things only, are contradicted by
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;</span>, by which the going forth is placed
beyond the beginning of creation; and <i>Cocceius</i>, by the fact that the
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> in the Old Testament, differently
from the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#923;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> in the New Testament, appears
always as going forth from God, in relation to the world only. But although the
&quot;time of old and the days of eternity&quot; should be considered as the place of the
going forth, yet the plural cannot be explained, as is done by <i>Caspari</i>, from
the circumstance that &quot;a person is always descended from several;&quot; for the transferring
of such a <i>usus loquendi</i> to a relation, to which in itself it is not applicable,
could be admitted only when it could be demonstrated to be altogether common and
firmly established. But the plural might indeed, although only with some difficulty,
be vindicated and accounted for from the circumstance, that two points of going
forth are mentioned, which, as it were, suppose a twofold act. 2. But even if the
singular were used, the explanation of the act of going forth would not be admissible.
It is contrary to the idea of nouns with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;</span>,
that they could be used as <i>nomina actionis</i>. It is only with writers living
at a time when the language was dying out, that a few instances of this erroneous
use can be found. <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;</span> denotes the place where,
the instrument wherewith, the time wherein, and perhaps the way and manner whereby,
something is done, or is. <i>Further</i>&mdash;It may signify also the thing itself which
is done, or is; but, in no writer of the living and flourishing language, does it
ever denote the action itself. <i>Caspari</i>, indeed, attempts to prove that &quot;there
occurs in the older books a number, by no means inconsiderable, of nouns with
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;</span>, which undeniably denote an action;&quot; but
what he has advanced on this point requires still to be minutely sifted, and to
be more closely examined; compare, <i>e.g.</i>, on Num. x. 2, my pamphlet on &quot;<i>The
Day of the Lord</i>,&quot; S. 32. But we are quite satisfied with what is granted by
<i>Caspari</i> himself (compare <i>Ewald&#39;s Lehrbuch d. Hebr. Spr.</i> § 160), that
it is against the nature and common use of this form to denote the action. Even
by this concession, a presumption is raised against the correctness of an interpretation
which would ascribe to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;</span>, here, and in
other passages, the signification of going forth, viewed as an action. The passages
quoted by <i>Winer</i> in favour of the signification, <i>egressus</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 489]</span> are the following: 1. Hos. vi. 3, where it
is said of the Lord <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1513;&#1495;&#1512; &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;</span>, &quot;firm
like the morning-dawn is His going forth.&quot; But <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;</span>
is there, not the action, but the place and the time of the going forth, as is evident
from the word &quot;firm&quot; also. 2. Ezek. xii. 4: &quot;And thou shalt go forth at even in
their sight, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497; &#1490;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;</span>.&quot; Several interpreters
agree that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;</span> here signifies the kind and
mode of the going forth. <i>Vatablus</i> says, &quot;It denotes the deportment of him
who goes forth, and means, Thou shalt go forth in sorrow, and indignant.&quot; But it
is better, with <i>Hävernick</i>, to refer it to the time: &quot;According to the goings
forth of prisoners, at the time when emigrants of this kind prefer to go forth from
their places.&quot; 3. Num. xxxiii. 2: &quot;And Moses wrote down
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;</span>, &#39;the places of their goings out.&#39;&quot;
4. Ps. xix. 7, it is said of the sun: <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;</span>, &quot;from the end of the heaven is his going forth,&quot; which is tantamount
to&mdash;The end of the heaven is the place from which he goes forth. 5. 1 Kings x. 28:
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1492;&#1505;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1500;&#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, which <i>De
Wette</i> translates, &quot;And the export of the horses which Solomon had, (was) from
Egypt.&quot; But a more accurate translation is, &quot;And the place of coming forth of the
horses which Solomon had was Egypt,&quot; or, more literally still, &quot;from Egypt,&quot;&mdash;a concise
mode of expression for, &quot;The place from which the horses of Solomon came forth was
Egypt,&quot;&mdash;just as in the preceding example. In proof of the signification, &quot;action
of going out,&quot; <i>Ch. B. Michaelis</i> refers, moreover, to 2 Sam. iii. 25, where
<i>De Wette</i> translates, &quot;Thou knowest Abner, the son of Ner; he came to deceive
thee, and to see thy going out and thy coming in, and all that thou doest.&quot; But
a more accurate translation would be, &quot;The place from which thou goest out, and
to which thou art going;&quot; compare Ezek. xliii. 11. In all other passages&mdash;and these
are rather numerous&mdash;the signification &quot;place of going out,&quot; or &quot;that which goes
out,&quot; is quite obvious. Even <i>Caspari</i> grants that the signification &quot;place
of going out&quot; has, <i>a priori</i>, the greatest probability in its favour.&mdash;To this
it may be added, that the signification &quot;place of going out&quot; is recommended here,
even by the contrast with what precedes, inasmuch as there Bethlehem, is mentioned
as the place from which the Euler in Israel is to come forth. With this place of
going out, another and a higher one is contrasted. This contrast also shows us how
the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 490]</span>
in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;</span> and <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;</span> must be understood, viz., in the same manner as
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span> in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1502;&#1498;</span>;
for the evident reference of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span> to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;</span> shows that it must correspond with
it. Hence the literal translation would be, &quot;And His places of going out are from
the times of old, from the days of eternity,&quot; which is equivalent to&mdash;The places
from which He goes forth are the times of old, the days of eternity,&mdash;just as in
the two passages, Ps. xix. 7; 1 Kings x. 28. The <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1502;&#1503;</span> might very well have been omitted; but its insertion here has arisen chiefly
from a desire to make the reference to the corresponding clause outwardly also more
perceptible. This reference shows also, that the explanation of
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</span> by <i>præ</i>, which was proposed by <i>
Pococke</i> and others, is inadmissible, besides involving an absurdity, inasmuch
as nothing can be <i>before</i> eternity; while, on the other hand, this reference
alone affords a satisfactory explanation of the plural. According to it, the words,
&quot;From the time of old, from the days of eternity,&quot; contain a gradation. <i>First</i>,
the existence of the Messiah before His birth in time, in Bethlehem, is pointed
out in general; and <i>then</i>, in contrast with all time, it is vindicated to
eternity. This could not fail to afford a great consolation to Israel. He who hereafter,
in a visible manifestation, was to deliver them from their misery, was already in
existence,&mdash;during it, before it, and through all eternity.</p>

<h2><span class="sc"><a name="div2_490" href="#div2Ref_490">HISTORY OF THE INTERPRETATION.</a></span></h2>
<h3><a name="div3_490" href="#div3Ref_490">1. AMONG THE JEWS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">This History, as to its essential features, might, <i>a priori</i>,
be sketched with tolerable certainty. From the nature of the case, we could scarcely
expect that the Jews should have adopted views altogether erroneous as to the subject
of the prophecy in question; for the Messiah appears in it, not in His humiliation,
but in His glory&mdash;rich in gifts and blessings, and Pelagian self-delusion will,
<i>a priori</i>, return an affirmative answer to the question as to whether one
is called to partake in them. But, on the other hand, the prophecy contains a twofold
ground of offence which had to be removed, and explained away at any
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 491]</span> expense. One of these, the eternity of the
Messiah&mdash;which was in contradiction to the popular notions, and conceivable only
from a knowledge of His Godhead&mdash;could not but exist at all times; while the second
of these&mdash;the birth at Bethlehem&mdash;made its appearance, and exercised its influence,
only after the birth of Christ. That this should be set aside, was demanded by two
causes. <i>First</i>, there was the desire of depriving the Christians of the proof,
which they derived from the birth at Bethlehem, for the proposition that He who
had appeared was also He who was promised. And, <i>secondly</i>, there was the difficulty
of any longer deriving from Bethlehem the descent of Christ, after, by an ordinance
of Hadrian (compare <i>Reland</i>, S. 647), all the Jews had been expelled from
Bethlehem and its neighbourhood. This difficulty was strongly urged against them
by Christian controversialists; compare <i>Tertullian cont. Jud.</i> c. xiii., &quot;How
then can the Ruler be descended from Judah, and how can He come forth from Bethlehem,
as, in the present day, there is not one of Israel left there, of whose family Christ
may be born?&quot; The actual history furnishes facts and details which only confirm
and enlarge what, in its essential features, we have sketched <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<p class="normal">1. The reference to the Messiah was, at all times, not the private
opinion of a few scholars, but was publicly received, and acknowledged with perfect
unanimity. As respects the time of Christ, this is obvious from Matt. ii. 5. According
to that passage, the whole Sanhedrim, when officially interrogated as to the birth-place
of the Messiah, supposed this explanation to be the only correct one. But if this
proof required a corroboration, it might be derived from John vii. 41, 42. In that
passage, several who erroneously supposed Christ to be a native of Galilee, objected
to His being the Messiah on the ground that Scripture says:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#960;&#8051;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#946;&#8054;&#948; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#914;&#951;&#952;&#955;&#949;&#8050;&#956; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#8061;&#956;&#951;&#962;,
&#8005;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#7974;&#957; &#916;&#945;&#946;&#8055;&#948;, &#8001; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;.</span> But even after Christ had appeared, the
interest in depriving the Christians at once of the arguments which, in their controversies,
they derived from this passage, was not sufficiently strong to blind the Jews to
the evident indications contained in this passage, or to induce them to deprive
themselves of the sweet hope which it afforded. This, it is true, would be the case
nevertheless, if we were to rely upon, and believe in the assertion of <i>Chrysostom</i>
(<i>Hom.</i> 7, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 492]</span> in Matt. c. 2, in <i>Nov.
Test.</i>, t. i. p. 80, ed. Frcf.): &quot;Some of them, in their impudence, assert that
this prophecy has a reference to Zerubbabel;&quot; of <i>Theodoret</i> (on this passage):
&quot;The Jews have tried to refer this to Zerubbabel, which evidently fights against
the truth;&quot; of <i>Theophylact</i> (on Matt. ii.); and of <i>Euthymius Zigabenus</i>
(in iv. <i>Evang.</i> t. 1, p. 61, ed. Mat.). But the supposition is here forced
upon us&mdash;a supposition which, in another case also (compare remarks on Zech. ix.
9, 10), we must acknowledge to be well-founded&mdash;that the Fathers, having in their
controversies with the Jews sometimes met a reference to Zerubbabel, forced it upon
the Jews, even when the latter themselves refused it. And there can be the less
difficulty in admitting this supposition, as the apparently fourfold testimony may
be easily reduced to a single one, viz., to that of <i>Chrysostom</i>. If these
statements had any truth in them, some traces, at least, of this interpretation
must be found among the Jews themselves. This, however, is not the case. All the
Jewish interpreters adhere to the Messianic interpretation, and in this they are
headed by the Chaldee, who paraphrases the words <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1502;&#1502;&#1498; &#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;</span> in this way: <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1504;&#1498; &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1508;&#1511; &#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488;</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, From thee Messiah shall go out before me.</p>
<p class="normal">2. A twofold method has been tried to remove the first ground
of objection mentioned above. In ancient times, they gave their full sense to the
words, &quot;Of (or from) the days of eternity,&quot; but substituted the name of the Messiah
for His person. This we meet with as early as in the Chaldee, who says:
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1491;&#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;</span>, <i>i.e.</i>,
&quot;Whose name is said (or called) from the days of old, from the days of eternity.&quot;
Thus also the <i>Pirke R. Elieser</i>, ch. iii., where, with a reference to the
passage before us, the name of the Messiah is mentioned among the seven things created
before the world existed, viz., along with the Law, Hell, Paradise, the Throne of
Glory, the Temple, Repentance; compare <i>Schöttgen</i> ii. S. 213. According to
<i>Eisenmenger</i> i. S. 317, the same, with some change, is found in the Talmud,
<i>Tract. Pesachim</i>, fol. 54, col. i., and <i>Nedarim</i> f. 39, c. 2. We cannot,
in that explanation by the Chaldee, understand &quot;name&quot; in its emphatic signification,
in which it often occurs in Scripture, viz., as an expression and image of the substance,&mdash;a
signification in which the &quot;name&quot; of the Messiah would be equivalent to &quot;the glory
of the Messiah,&quot; or to &quot;the Messiah <span class="pagenum">[Pg 493]</span> in His
glory.&quot; This is evident from the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, <i>
i.e.</i>, &quot;said&quot; or &quot;spoken,&quot; of the Chaldee, which does not allow of our thinking
of the creation of a substance; and not less from the consideration, that if this
signification of &quot;name&quot; were assumed, the aim and object which he had in view in
substituting &quot;name&quot; for &quot;person&quot; at all, would have been missed. The name of the
Messiah expresses His nature, the idea of His existence. The creation or pronouncing
of this name marks, accordingly, the rise of this idea in God,&mdash;His forming the decree
of redemption by the Messiah. By this explanation&mdash;which we again meet with, afterwards,
in <i>Calvin</i>, and which we shall then consider more minutely&mdash;a mere existence
in thought, was substituted for the real existence of the Messiah,&mdash;His predestination,
for His pre-existence.&mdash;But in aftertimes they came still further down. To supply
&quot;the name,&quot; was too arbitrary to admit of their resting satisfied with such an explanation.
Almost unanimously they now came to the supposition, that the words of the passage
under consideration merely marked the descent of the Messiah from the ancient, royal
house of David. Thus <i>Abenezra</i>: &quot;All this is said of David; the words also,
&#39;His goings out are of old,&#39; refer to David.&quot; <i>Aberbanel</i> (<i>Praec. Sal.</i>
p. 62): &quot;The goings out of the family from which that Ruler is to be descended are
of old, and of the days of eternity, <i>i.e.</i>, of the seed of David, and the
rod of Jesse, which is of Bethlehem-Judah.&quot; On the similar expositions of <i>Kimchi</i>
and others, compare <i>Frischmuth l.c.</i>, and <i>Wichmannshausen</i>, <i>Dissert.
on the pass.</i>, Wittenb. 1722, S. 6 ff. We could not urge against this exposition
that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> is erroneously understood either
as &quot;going out,&quot; or, as &quot;family;&quot; and that, in the latter signification, the <i>usus
loquendi</i>, as well as the evident reference to <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">
&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;</span>, are disregarded. For that might be given up, and yet the explanation
would stand as to its substance. Even then, it might be translated: &quot;His goings
out (in the signification of &#39;places of going out&#39;) are the days of old, the days
of eternity,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, the very ancient times; so that there would be ascribed
to the time something which belongs to that which exists in it, viz., to the family
of David. But the following reason is decisive against it. Every one will admit
that the eternal origin of the Messiah forms a far more suitable contrast with His
temporal origin from Bethlehem, than His descent from the ancient family of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 494]</span> David. The latter would come into consideration
here, only on account of its antiquity; a reference to its dignity is not made by
even a single word, nor is the family itself mentioned at all in the text; but the
attribute of antiquity, and that alone, is nevertheless taken from it, and ascribed
to the Messiah. But now, we cannot at all see what pre-eminence in this respect
the family of David enjoyed above other families, and how, therefore, it could have
been an honour for the Messiah to be descended from it. How strange would, according
to this explanation, be the words, &quot;of the days of eternity,&quot; which, as a climax,
are added to, &quot;of days of old!&quot; What reason could there have existed for the prophet
to exalt, by a hyperbolical expression, a limited time to eternity? As regards His
human origin, the Messiah had not the slightest advantage over other mortals, as
far as the age of the family was concerned. What, then, was the use of such a hyperbole
in a matter which, in this connection, was of no consequence, and which could not
in any way serve for His exaltation? It is just this, however, which after all is
required by the contrast. What kind of consolation would thereby have been afforded
to the people? Certainly no one doubted that the Messiah would have parents, and
ancestors reaching back to a hoar antiquity. But was there anything gained by this,
since He had it only in common with the lowest and feeblest among the people? How
does this shallow, unmeaning, and yet so much pretending contrast in reference to
the Messiah, suit the other contrast in reference to Bethlehem, which is so brilliant
and exalted? And now what reason is there for preferring that explanation which
is so unnatural, to the other, which is so natural, so obvious, which presents a
contrast so beautiful, and opens up to the Covenant-people a source of consolation
so rich? Is it this, perhaps, that the eternity of the Messiah is not mentioned
anywhere else in the Old Testament? But the eternity of the Messiah is only a single
feature of His divine nature, and just that feature which, according to the context,
came here into special consideration. <i>Caspari</i> very correctly remarks: &quot;The
prophet pointed out just the feature of the pre-existence, and of the eternal existence
of the Messiah, and these only, because the announcement of His origin from the
little Bethlehem led just to this, and to this alone.&quot; The intimation of the divine
nature of the Messiah is, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 495]</span> however, as old
as the Messianic prediction in general; compare, concerning this, my remarks on
Gen. xlix. 10. In a more definite shape, and in a more distinct form, it appears
as early as in the Messianic Psalms. But it is found, in sharply defined outlines,
in Isaiah, and specially in ix. 5, where, just as in the passage before us, the
divine glory of the Messiah is contrasted with the lower aspect of His existence;
and the closer the points of contact are between Isaiah and Micah, the less can
we refuse to acknowledge such here. This circumstance also must prevent us from
doing so, that immediately afterwards, in ver. 3 (4), the divine dignity and nature
of the Messiah meet us anew. This passage requires, as its foundation, the one upon
which we are now commenting. Moreover, the eternity which, in contrast with His
birth in time, is here ascribed to the Messiah, corresponds with the eternity of
His existence and dominion after His birth, which is repeatedly ascribed to the
Messiah, and, most prominently, in Is. ix. 5, where He receives the name &quot;Father
of eternity,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, He who will be Father in all eternity.&mdash;Some one, perhaps,
would infer from the subjoined words, &quot;of the days,&quot; that
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;</span> is here to be understood in a limited
sense. But who does not know that, when eternity is predicated in contrast with
a limited duration of time, just to make the contrast the more striking, those measures
of time, which are properly applicable to the latter only, are transferred to the
former? For in order to be able to compare things, a certain resemblance between
them must necessarily be first established. Thus in Dan. vii. 9, God is called &quot;the
Ancient of Days;&quot; thus it is said of Him in Ps. cii. 28, &quot;Thy years have no end;&quot;
and the New Testament frequently speaks in the same way of eternal times. We are,
in our thoughts, generally so much bound to time, that we can conceive of eternity
only as &quot;time without time.&quot; It cannot by any means be satisfactorily or incontrovertibly
proved from vii. 14, 20, that <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;</span> and
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;</span> here designate merely the ancient
time. All which that passage proves is, that such a sense is possible&mdash;and this,
no one probably has ever doubted&mdash;but not that it is applicable in this connection.
If the connection be considered, Prov. viii. 22, 23, will then be acknowledged to
be parallel,&mdash;a passage in which the eternal existence of Wisdom is spoken of in
a similar manner.</p>
<p class="normal">3. That, in the prophecy under consideration, Bethlehem is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</span> marked out as the birth-place of the Messiah,
was held as an undoubted truth by the ancient Jews. This appears from the confident
reply of the Sanhedrim to the question of Herod as to the birth-place of Christ.
And it is not less evident from John vii. 42. The circumstance that, after the tumult
raised by Barcochba, not only Jerusalem, but Bethlehem also, was, by the Emperor
Adrian, interdicted to the Jews as a residence, renders it probable that this interpretation
was not given up immediately after the death of Christ. But even after this edict
of Adrian, and after the difficulty had appeared in all its force, they did not,
for a considerable time, venture to assert that the prophecy knew nothing of Bethlehem
as the birth-place of the Messiah. It is with the later Rabbinical interpreters
only, who were better skilled in the art of distorting, that this assertion is found.
The ancient Jews endeavoured to evade the difficulty by the fable, dressed up in
various ways, that the Messiah was indeed born at Bethlehem, on the day of the destruction
of the temple, but that, on account of the sins of the people. He was afterwards
carried away by a storm, and had, since that time, remained, unknown and concealed,
in various places. Thus speak the Talmud, the very ancient commentary on Lamentations,
<i>Echa Rabbati</i>, and the very old commentary on Genesis, <i>Breshith Rabba</i>
(compare the passages in <i>Raim. Martini</i>, S. 348-50; <i>Carpzovius</i> and
<i>Frischmuth</i>, l.c.). Indeed, we can trace this fiction still farther back.
Closely connected with it is the explanation of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;
&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;</span> by &quot;darkness of the daughter of Zion&quot; (<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;</span>
being confounded with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;</span>), <i>i.e.</i>, hidden
on account of Zion. This explanation is found as early as in Jonathan. The concealment
of the Messiah is only an isolated feature of this fiction. The fiction itself,
indeed, has its roots, not only in the passage under review, but also in the endeavour
to remove the contradiction between the destruction of the temple, and the firm
expectation of the Messiah&#39;s appearing during the time of its existence,&mdash;an expectation
founded on passages of the Old Testament. This concealment of the Messiah is mentioned
as early as in the <i>Dialogus cum Tryphone</i> (No. 8 <i>Bened. Ven.</i>; compare
also p. 114): &quot;Christ, even if he be born, and exist anywhere, is unknown, and neither
manifests himself in any way, nor has he any power until Elijah come, etc.&quot; In order
to be convinced that, at the time when this book was composed,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 497]</span> and hence in the second century, the fiction
was already fully developed, we need only compare the account in <i>Breshith Rabba</i>.
After Elijah, at the time of the birth of the Messiah, had visited his mother in
Bethlehem Judah, and consoled her who was afflicted on account of the destruction
of the temple, which was contemporaneous with her delivery, he withdraws. &quot;After
five years had elapsed, he said, I will go and see the Saviour of Israel, whether
he be nursed up in the manner of kings or of ministering angels. He went and found
the woman standing at the door of her house, and said to her: My daughter, in what
state is that boy? And she answered him: Rabbi, did I not tell thee that it is a
bad thing to nurse him, because, on the day on which he was born, the temple was
destroyed? But this is not all; for <i>he has feet and walks not, he has eyes and
sees not, he has ears and hears not, he has a mouth and does not speak at all, and
there he lies like a stone.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The Rabbinical interpreters felt, however, that this fiction,
being destitute of all warrant, was of no use to them in their controversies with
Christians; and it was to these that their view was chiefly directed. Hence they
sought to remove the difficulty by means of the interpretation; and as all had the
same interest, the result was that the distorted explanation became as generally
prevalent, as the correct one had formerly been. <i>Kimchi</i>, <i>Abenezra</i>,
<i>Abendana</i>, <i>Abarbanel</i>, and, in general, all the later Rabbins (compare
the passages in <i>Wichmannsh.</i> l. c. S. 9), maintain that Bethlehem is mentioned
here as the birth-place of the Messiah indirectly only,&mdash;in so far only as the Messiah
was to be descended from David the Bethlehemite. There cannot well be a prepossession
in favour of this exposition. The circumstance that, formerly, no one ever thought
that it was even possible to explain the passage under review in any other way than
that, in it, Bethlehem is spoken of as the birth-place of the Messiah, and that
this exposition was discovered and introduced, only at a time when the other could
no longer be received, raises, <i>a priori</i>, strong suspicions against it. And
this suspicion is fully confirmed by a closer examination. <i>Cæteris paribus</i>,
that explanation which here finds Bethlehem mentioned as the birth-place of the
Messiah, would deserve the preference, even for this reason, that the passage, as
thus understood, fills up a blank <span class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</span> in the Messianic
prophecy,&mdash;and that from the whole analogy, we are led to expect that no such blank
would be left. Should the family from which Christ was to descend, the time at which
He was to appear, the part of the country which was pre-eminently to enjoy His blessings,
and so many other things concerning Him, have been so minutely foretold, and not
the place where He was to be born? Even the question of Herod,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#959;&#8166; &#8001; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#8118;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>; shows how much reason
we have, <i>a priori</i>, to expect such a prediction. He supposes that, as a matter
of course, the birth-place of the Messiah must have been determined in the Old Testament;
he only inquires about the place where. But the matter is not so, that there could
be any choice at all betwixt the two explanations. If we suppose that it is only
the descent of the Messiah from the family of David which is here announced, the
contrast between the natural littleness of Bethlehem, and its divine greatness,
would be very far from being appropriate. After the family of David had, for centuries,
resided and ruled at Jerusalem, the natural littleness of Bethlehem came very little
into further consideration. It was not this which could render improbable the appearance
of the Messiah. It was only the downfall of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the
King&#39;s Castle, which were in opposition to the belief in the Messiah&#39;s appearance.
And, in like manner, the glory, resulting from His appearance, was not imparted
to Bethlehem, but to Zion. Hence it is that, in iv. 8, where the prophet wishes
to declare the descent of the Messiah from the family of David, he contrasts the
glorification of Zion, and especially of the King&#39;s Castle, with its previous degradation.&mdash;<i>Further</i>&mdash;There
is not a single instance to be found of a place, in which the ancestors of some
one resided centuries ago, being spoken of as the place of his descent. Is there
a single passage in which Bethlehem is mentioned as the native place of any of the
kings from the Davidic dynasty who were born at Jerusalem, or as the native place
of Zerubbabel who was born at Babylon? For further details concerning this argument,
<i>Huetius</i>, <i>dem. Evang.</i> p 579 <i>ed. Amstel.</i> 1680, maybe compared.&mdash;<i>Further</i>&mdash;The
relation of the passage under review to the parallel passage Is. viii. 23 (ix. 1)
must not be overlooked. As in the latter text, the <i>province</i> is marked out
which, by the appearance of the Messiah, is to be raised from the deepest degradation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 499]</span> to the highest glory, so, in the passage under
consideration, the <i>place</i> is designated.&mdash;<i>Finally</i>&mdash;If any doubt yet remained,
it must surely be removed by the fulfilment,&mdash;by the fact that Christ was actually
born at Bethlehem; and this so much the more, that this fact cannot be looked upon
as an accidental circumstance, for Bethlehem was not the residence of His parents.</p>
<p class="normal">But the Jews endeavoured, in another way, to wrest from Christian
controversialists the advantage afforded by this passage. They denied altogether
that Christ was born at Bethlehem. Thus <i>Abr. Peritsol</i> (compare <i>Eisenmenger</i>,
l. c. S. 259): &quot;Since they called Him Jesus the Nazarene, and not Jesus the Bethlehemite,
it is to be inferred that He was born at Nazareth, as it is written in the <i>Targum</i>
of Jerusalem.&quot; Upon this point, however, there existed no unanimity among them.
<i>David Gans</i>, in the Book <i>Zemach David</i>, mentions, without any remark,
Bethlehem as the birth-place of the Messiah (S. 105 of <i>Vorst&#39;s</i> translation).</p>
<h3><a name="div3_499" href="#div3Ref_499">2. AMONG THE CHRISTIANS.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">The conviction that Christ is the subject of the prophecy under
consideration was so much the prevailing one in the Christian Church, that the mention
of any of its defenders is altogether superfluous. It were more interesting to learn
who were the opponents of it. The assertion of <i>Huetius</i>, l. c., that <i>Chrysostom</i>,
<i>Theophylact</i>, and <i>Euthymius Zigabenus</i> attempted an explanation by which
it was referred to Zerubbabel, rests on a misapprehension resulting from want of
memory. <i>Huetius</i> himself ascribes to them that very view which they most decidedly
oppose as the one alleged to be held by the Jews. But this interpretation was actually
advanced by <i>Theodorus</i> of <i>Mopsueste</i>, whose exegetical tendencies it
admirably suited. Along with several other interpretations, it was condemned by
the Council at Rome, under Pope Vigilius; compare <i>H. Prado</i> on Ezek. <i>prooem.
Sect.</i> 3, and <i>Hippol. a Lapide in prophet. min. prooem.</i>, and in the remarks
on this passage. The immediate successor of <i>Theodorus</i> was <i>Grotius</i>.
His book <i>de veritate relig. Christ.</i>&mdash;where in i. 5, § 17 (p. 266, ed. Oxon.
1820), he proves <span class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</span> against the Jews the Messianic
dignity of Christ, from the circumstance that He was, in accordance with the passage,
born at Bethlehem&mdash;might, indeed, entitle us to infer that he was not confirmed in
this opinion. But perhaps he only imagined that, in a popular work, he needed not
to be so careful, and that, even according to his own views, he had retained a certain
right to this use of the passage, inasmuch as he considered Zerubbabel as a type
of Christ, and the birth of the latter at Bethlehem as an outward representation
of His descent from the Davidic family. It was at the commencement of the Rationalistic
period, when an easier mode of evading the reference to Christ had not as yet been
discovered, that the reference to Zerubbabel was seized upon. It is found in <i>
Dathe</i> and <i>Kuehnöl</i> (<i>Mess. Weissagungen</i>, S. 88). The latter, however,
changed his opinion (compare Commentary on Matt. ii.), after such a mode had been
discovered, by referring the prophecy to the <i>ideal</i> Christ. From that time
onwards, the reference to the <i>ideal</i> Christ is found in almost all the Rationalistic
interpreters. The distinctness with which the marks here given, viz., the birth
in time at Bethlehem, and the eternity of the origin, lead to the <i>historical</i>
Christ; and the difficulty of explaining these when the prophecy is referred to
the <i>ideal</i> Messiah, are rendered sufficiently evident by the efforts which
all these interpreters, without exception, have made to explain these marks away.
Who does not discover, in these very efforts, a confession of their force, on the
supposition that they can be, as they have already been, demonstrated to have an
actual existence? God Himself has borne witness by facts against this explanation;
for He ordered the circumstance in such a manner that, by the birth of Christ at
Bethlehem, the prophecy was fulfilled. But how can a fulfilment be spoken of by
those who do not believe in prophecy, but see in it human conjectures only, since
the very idea of prophecy necessarily implies divine inspiration? How should God
have impressed His own seal upon mere human conjectures, as He would have done by
effecting an apparent fulfilment? He would Himself have surely become the author
of error by so doing. <i>Finally</i>,&mdash;We shall afterwards see that, in the New Testament,
this passage has been explained in the strictest sense, of the historical Christ;
and the attempts of the Rationalistic interpreters to divest that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 501]</span> quotation of its import, will furnish us with
a proof, that it is not truth for which they are concerned, but the removal only,
at any rate and cost, of a fact which is irreconcilable with their system. All that
has been advanced by them (<i>e.g.</i>, by <i>Justi</i> and <i>Ammon</i>) against
the reference to the historical Christ, rests on their misapprehension of Christ&#39;s
Regal office. The Regal office of Christ is by no means a poetical image, but the
most <i>real</i> among all kingly offices; yea. His kingdom is that from which all
others derive their existence and reality. It rests, <i>further</i>, on their ignorance
as regards the final history of the Messianic kingdom. Of the whole history of Christ,
they know a single fragment only, viz.. His first appearance in His humiliation;
and even this they know, and can know, only very imperfectly. His invisible dominion
existing even now, they do not recognise, because it is beheld with the eye of faith
only; and His future visible manifestation of it they do not believe, because they
have not experienced in their own hearts the invisible power of Christ, which is
a pledge and earnest of this visible success. It rests, <i>finally</i>, on their
ignorance of the prophetic vision, which necessarily requires that the kingdom of
God under the Old Testament should serve as a substratum for the description of
the kingdom of Christ. It can be demonstrated, from the intimations contained in
this passage, in which the Messiah appears in His glory, how little it is contradictory
to others, in which He is represented in His lowest humiliation. Through humiliation
to glory,&mdash;this is the proposition which lies at the foundation of the announcements
of the prophet concerning the destinies of the Covenant-people, and which he distinctly
expresses in regard to Bethlehem. That this proposition is applicable to the Head
not less than to the members,&mdash;to Him who was born, not less than to the place where
He was born, appears from the circumstance that He was to be born at the time of
the deepest degradation of the Davidic dynasty, iv. 8, and not at Jerusalem, where
His Royal ancestors resided, but at Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="normal">2. As regards the last words of this verse, the same twofold false
interpretation which we noticed among Jewish interpreters, is found among Christian
expositors also. One of these, which, besides in other Jewish interpreters, occurs
in <i>Jarchi</i> (&quot;<i>and His goings out</i>, etc.; just as in Ps. lxxii. 17, it
was said that His name <span class="pagenum">[Pg 502]</span> should continue as
long as the sun;&mdash;thus <i>Jonathan</i> also translated it&quot;), changes the eternal
origin of Christ into an eternal predestination. This view was held by <i>Calvin</i>:
&quot;These words,&quot; he says, &quot;signify that the rising of the Prince who was to rule the
nations would not be something sudden, but long ago decreed by God. I know that
some pertinaciously insist that the prophet speaks here of Christ&#39;s eternal essence,
and as far as I am concerned, I <i>willingly</i> acknowledge that Christ&#39;s eternal
Godhead is here proved to us; but as we shall never succeed in convincing the Jews
of this, I prefer to hold that the words of the prophet signify that Christ would
not thus suddenly proceed from Bethlehem, as if God had formerly decreed nothing
concerning Him.&quot; He speaks indeed of his &quot;<i>willingly</i> acknowledging;&quot; but that
he was not very much in earnest in his willingness, appears from what follows: &quot;Others
advance a new and ingenious view,&quot; etc. It is only from the relation of <i>Calvin</i>
to the earlier interpreters, that we can account for his advancing an exposition
so very arbitrary. These had, <i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>, advanced a multitude
of forced expositions. Calvin, who very properly hated such interpretations (&quot;I
do not like such distorted explanations,&quot; he says, in his commentary on Joel ii.),
always regarded them with suspicion; and whensoever there was the appearance of
any motive which may possibly have guided them in adopting a certain explanation,
he himself, rather than concur with them, falls upon the most unnatural explanations
in return. The best refutation of his exposition is to be found in <i>Pococke</i>.
It is absurd to suppose that the actual going forth of Christ from Bethlehem is
here contrasted with one which is merely imaginary,&mdash;the action, with a mere decree.
It is without any analogy that some one should be designated as actually existing,
or going forth, who exists merely in the divine foreknowledge, or the divine predestination.&mdash;The
other view, which regards the last words of this verse as referring to the Messiah&#39;s
descent from the ancient family of David, is found among all interpreters who, from
some cause, were prevented from adopting the sound one. It is thus with the Socinians
(compare, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Volkel de vera religione</i>, l. 5, c. 2), some of whom,
in order the more surely to set aside a passage so damaging to their system, supposed
that, according to its proper sense, it did not refer to Christ at all; <i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Jo. Crellius</i>, who, in his exposition of Matt. ii., asserts that it refers
indefinitely to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 503]</span> some one of the family of
David who, after the Babylonish captivity, was to rule the nation. It is thus with
<i>Grotius</i> also, who says: &quot;He (Zerubbabel) has his origin from the days of
old, from ancient times, <i>i.e.</i>, he has descended from a house, illustrious
from ancient times, and governing for five hundred years.&quot; Thus it is with all the
Rationalistic interpreters. Among recent faithful Christian expositors, <i>Jahn</i>
also (<i>Vatic. Mess.</i> 2, p. 147) has been led away to the adoption of this opinion.
But that he felt strongly, at least, one of the difficulties which stood in its
way, viz., that if the reference to the family of David be assumed, it is the mere
age of the family, apart from every preference on the ground of its dignity, which
is mentioned to magnify the Messiah&mdash;appears from the strange exegetical process
which he employs for the purpose of removing it. He supplies at the end, <i>celebris
est</i>:&mdash;His origin or His family (thus he erroneously explains
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span>) is <i>celebrated</i> from ancient
times.&quot; One may see in this case how much, in particulars, an individual still remains
dependent upon a community, even although, upon the whole, he may have freed himself
from such dependence. For it is certainly from this dependence alone that the fact
can be accounted for, that this commentator rejected an exposition which must have
been to him the most agreeable, which has everything in its favour, and nothing
against it,&mdash;and chose another instead, the nakedness of which he was obliged to
cover as well as he could, while, in so doing, he was violating his <i>exegetical
convictions</i>. <i>Ewald</i> also permits himself to introduce into the passage
what is necessary for the sense which he has made up his mind to adopt. In place
of the simple antiquity, he puts: &quot;Descended from the ancient, venerable royal family
of David.&quot; The view taken by <i>Hofmann</i> is peculiar: &quot;He comes from the family
of David, just as it had happened long ago, when that family still belonged to the
community of Bethlehem,&mdash;from the community of Bethlehem does He come.&quot; <i>Weiss.
u. Erf.</i> 1, S. 251. In order to get at this rather superfluous repetition, he
has substituted the manner in which the family of David formerly existed, for &quot;the
days of old, and eternity.&quot; The &quot;origins&quot; (this is the sense which he gives to
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;</span>) cannot be attributed to that portion
only of David&#39;s family which dwelt at Bethlehem; for He was descended from them
indirectly only, through the royal family of David.</p>
<p class="continue"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 504]</span></p>
<p class="normal">3. The Jewish assertion, that in the prophecy there is no allusion
to the birth at Bethlehem of Him who was to come, could not fail to be repeated
by <i>Grotius</i> and his supporters, inasmuch as Zerubbabel was not born at Bethlehem.
&quot;Zerubbabel,&quot; he says, &quot;is rightly said to have been born at Bethlehem, because
he was of the family of David which had its origin there.&quot; This is, in like manner,
repeated by the Rationalistic interpreters, in order to avoid the too close coincidence
of the prophecy with the actual history of Christ, <i>e.g.</i>, by <i>Paulus</i>
and <i>Strauss</i> (both, in their &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;), and by <i>Hitzig</i>. It is
remarkable, however, that, in order the more securely to attain this object, some
have gone so far even as to follow the example of several Jews, and of the infamous
<i>Bodinus</i> (<i>de abditis rerum sublimium arcanis</i>, l. 5, compare the refutation
by <i>Huetius</i>, l.c. p. 701), and to characterize the evangelical account concerning
the birth of Christ at Bethlehem as unworthy of credit. Such has been the case with
<i>Ammon</i> especially.</p>
<hr class="W20">
<h3><a name="div3_504" href="#div3Ref_504">THE QUOTATION IN MATT. II. 6.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">Several interpreters, <i>Paulus</i> especially, have asserted
that the interpretation of Micah which is here given, was that of the Sanhedrim
only, and not of the Evangelist, who merely recorded what happened and was said.
But this assertion is at once refuted when we consider the object which Matthew
has in view in his entire representation of the early life of Jesus. His object
in recording the early life of Jesus is not like that of Luke, viz., to communicate
historical information to his readers. The historical event which he could suppose
to be already known to <i>his</i> readers, comes into his view only in so far as
it served for the confirmation of Old Testament prophecies. Hence it is that he
touches upon any historical circumstance, just when the mention of it can serve
for the attainment of this purpose. Thus, the design of the genealogy is to prove
that, in accordance with the prophecies of the Old Testament, Christ was descended
from Abraham, through David. Thus all which he mentions in chap. i. 18-21, serves
only to prepare the way for the quotation of the prophecy of Isaiah, that the Messiah
was to be born of a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</span> virgin, which is subjoined
in ver. 22, with the words: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#8050; &#8005;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#8051;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;
&#7989;&#957;&#945; &#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;.</span> Even the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> proves that
all which precedes is mentioned solely with a view to the prophecy. The
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#945;</span> of <i>Olshausen</i> which refers
the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> to the whole, in contrast with the
particular, can be accounted for only from the embarrassment into which this commentator
could not here avoid falling by his interpretation of the prophecy of Isaiah, according
to which a semblance of agreement is, with the utmost difficulty, made out betwixt
it, and the event in which Matthew finds its fulfilment. Moreover, all the single
features of the account have too distinct a reference to the prophecy which is to
be afterwards quoted. It is from a regard to it, that he is most anxious to point
out that Christ was conceived by a pure and immaculate virgin, that, in ver. 25,
he expressly adds that before the birth of Jesus, Mary had had no connubial intercourse
with Joseph, because Immanuel was not only to be conceived, but born of a virgin.
The words, <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span>,
correspond exactly with <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#7960;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#8053;&#955;</span>. The Evangelist explains the latter name by
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#956;&#949;&#952;&#8125; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#8001; &#920;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</span>, which, again, cannot be without
an object, for the name of Jesus (<i>Gottheil</i>, <i>God-Salvation</i>) has, with
him, the same signification. We pass over, in the meantime, the section ii. 1-12.
In ver. 13 there follows the account of the flight into Egypt with a reference to
Hos. xi. 1. This passage refers, in the first instance, to Israel; but Israel does
not here come into view according to its carnal condition, but only according to
its divine destination and election,&mdash;as is evidently shown by the designation &quot;Son
of God.&quot; Israel was called to preserve the truth of God in the midst of error, to
proclaim among the Gentiles the mighty acts of God, and to be His messenger and
ambassador. In this respect Israel was a type of the Messiah, and the latter, as
it were, a concentrated and exalted Israel. It is from this relation alone that
many passages in the second part of Isaiah can be explained; and in Is. xlix. 3,
the Messiah is expressly called Israel. If, then, there existed between Israel and
the Messiah such a relation of type and Antitype;&mdash;if this relation was not accidental,
but designed by God, it will, <i>a priori</i>, appear to us most probable that the
abode of the children of Israel in Egypt, and the residence of Christ in the same
country, have a relation to each other. This supposition rests upon the perception
of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span> remarkable coincidence which, by divine
Providence, generally exists betwixt the destinies of typical persons, and those
of the Antitype, so that the former may be considered as an actual prophecy of the
latter. But this coincidence must here not be sought in the stay in the same country
only; this circumstance served only to direct attention to the deeper unity, to
represent it outwardly. It was not from their own choice, but from a series of the
most remarkable dispensations of Providence, and on the express command of God,
that Israel went to Egypt. They thereby escaped from the destruction which threatened
them in the land for which they were really destined. They were there prepared for
their destiny; and when that preparation was finished, they were, agreeably to the
promise of God, which was given to them even before they went down into Egypt, introduced
into that land in which their destiny was to be realized. The same providence of
God which there chose the means for the preservation of His kingdom, which was at
that time bound up with the existence of the typical Israel, chose the same means
now also when their hopes concentrated themselves in the person of their future
Head. It was necessary that Egypt should afford Him a safe abode until the danger
was over.&mdash;There then follows, in vers. 16-19, the account of the murder of the children
of Bethlehem, with a sole reference to Jer. xxxi. 15, and just on account of it.
Here, too, we must not think of a simple simile only. In Jeremiah, the mother of
Israel laments over the destruction of her children. The Lord appears and comforts
her. Her grief is, at some future time, to be changed into joy. She is to see the
salvation which the Lord will still bestow upon her sons. That which, therefore,
constitutes the essence of that passage is the contrast of the merited punishment
which Israel drew down upon themselves by their sins, with the unmerited salvation
which the mercy of the Lord will bestow upon them. Now, quite the same contrast
is perceptible in the event under consideration. In the same manner as the tyranny
of the Chaldeans, so that of Herod also was a deserved punishment for the sins of
the Covenant-people. Herod, by birth a foreigner, was, like Nebuchadnezzar, a rod
of correction in the hand of the Lord. The cruel deed which, with divine permission,
he committed at the very place in which the Saviour was born, was designed actually
and visibly to remind the Covenant-people <span class="pagenum">[Pg 507]</span>
of what they had deserved by their sins,&mdash;was intended also to be a matter-of-fact
prophecy of the impending more comprehensive judgment, and thus to make it manifest
that so much the more plainly, the sending of the Messiah was purely a work of divine
mercy, destined for those only who would recognise it as such. From this it appears
that the Old Testament event, to which the prophet, in the first instance, refers,
viz., the carrying away into captivity, and the deliverance from it, were prophecies
by deeds of those New Testament relations (in which, however, the typical relation
of the murder of the children at Bethlehem, as we have stated it, must not be overlooked);&mdash;that
both were subject to the same laws, that both were a necessary result of the working
of the same divine mercy, and that hence, a declaration which, in the first instance,
referred to the first event, might at the same time be considered as a prophecy
of the second.&mdash;Vers. 19 and 20 have for their foundation Exod. iv. 19, where the
Lord, after having ordered Moses to return to Egypt, subjoins the words:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#949;&#952;&#957;&#8053;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#959;&#7985; &#950;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#8051;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>.
That which the Lord there speaks to Moses, and that which, here. He speaks to Joseph,
proceed from the same cause. Like all servants of God under the Old Testament, Moses
is a type of Christ. There is the same overruling by divine Providence, the same
direction of all events for the good of the kingdom of God. Moses is first withdrawn
from threatening danger by flight into distant regions. As soon as it is time that
he should enter upon his vocation, the door for the return to the scene of his activity
is opened to him. Just so is it with regard to Christ.&mdash;Vers. 21-23 have for their
sole foundation the prophetic declaration: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#925;&#945;&#950;&#969;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;
&#954;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> (compare, on these words, the remarks on Is. xi.). The particular
circumstances which are mentioned, viz., that Joseph had the intention of settling
in Judea, but received from God the command to go into Galilee, are designed only
to make it more perceptible that the fulfilment of this prophecy was willed by God.</p>
<p class="normal">From this summary it sufficiently appears that the object of Matthew
in chap. i. and ii. was by no means of an historical, but rather of a doctrinal
nature; and since this is the case, all the objections fall to the ground, which
<i>Sieffert</i>, solely by disregarding this object of the writer, has lately drawn
from these <span class="pagenum">[Pg 508]</span> chapters against the genuineness
of Matthew&#39;s Gospel. And if we apply this to the question before us, it follows
that the section ii. 1-12 must likewise have an Old Testament foundation. That this
foundation can, in the first instance, be sought for only in the prophecy of Micah,
becomes evident from the circumstance, that Bethlehem is, in ver. 1, mentioned as
Christ&#39;s birth-place. If we now take into consideration the fact that the Evangelist
does not mention at all that the parents of Jesus formerly resided at Nazareth,
just because it had no reference to any prophecy of the Old Testament (it is merely
by designating, in the account of the birth of Jesus, Bethlehem as the place of
His parents, that he intimates that that which had been previously reported had
happened in a different place),&mdash;and that, on the other hand, he mentions the residence
of the Holy Family at Nazareth, after their return from Egypt, evidently for the
sole purpose of bringing it into connection with a prophecy,&mdash;it becomes quite evident
that it is not from any historical interest that this circumstance, which was known
to all his readers, is mentioned. To this it may be further added, that the account
given in vers. 1-6, especially the communication of the answer of the Sanhedrim
to the question of Herod, would, according to the proved object and aim of Matthew,
stand altogether without a purpose, unless he had considered the answer of the Doctors
as being in harmony with the truth, and hence as superseding his usual formula,
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945; &#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;</span>. In order to show how much Matthew
was guided by a regard to the Old Testament, and how frequently, at the same time,
he contented himself with a mere allusion, supposing his readers to be acquainted
with the Old Testament&mdash;as is quite evident from vers. 20 and 23&mdash;we must further
consider the second Old Testament reference which he has in view in vers. 1-12.
The passages to which he refers are Ps. lxxii. 10: &quot;The kings of Sheba and Seba
shall offer gifts;&quot; and Is. lx. 6: &quot;All they from Sheba shall come, they shall bring
gold and incense, and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord.&quot; The representation,
in these and other similar passages, is, in the first instance, a figurative one.
Gifts are in the East a sign of allegiance. The fundamental thought is this: &quot;The
most distant, the wealthiest, and the most powerful nations of the earth shall do
homage to the Messiah, and consecrate to Him themselves and all that they have.&quot;
But that which is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 509]</span> prophesied by a figurative
representation in these Old Testament passages began to be fulfilled by the symbolical
action of the Magi, by which the image was represented externally; for the gold,
incense, and myrrh which they consecrated to the new-born King of the Jews symbolized
the homage which they offered to Him; and these gifts are certainly expressly mentioned
by Matthew for this reason, that they occur in the Old Testament passages. As this
event formed, in one respect, the beginning of the fulfilment, so, in another, it
formed a new prophecy by deeds,&mdash;the type of a new, greater, and more proper fulfilment.
The Apostles considered these Magi as the types and representatives of the whole
mass of heathen nations who were, at a subsequent period, to do homage to the Messiah.
They were the ambassadors, as it were, of the heathen world, to greet the new-born
King, just as the shepherds, whom God Himself had chosen, were the deputies of the
Jews. In my work on Balaam, pp. 480-482, I have proved that, even with these references,
the contents of the passage are not yet exhausted,&mdash;that there still remains a prominent
point, viz., the star which the Magi saw, and that this refers to Balaam&#39;s prophecy
of the star proceeding from Jacob.</p>
<p class="normal">But if it be established that the view of the prophecy under consideration,
which the Evangelist reports as that of the Sanhedrim, must, at the same time, be
considered as his own, we must also suppose that the quotation, even in its particulars,
is approved by him, and that the view which was first advanced by <i>Jerome</i>
(&quot;I believe that he wished to exhibit the negligence of the scribes and priests,
and wrote it down as it had been spoken by them&quot;), and recently by <i>Paulus</i>,
cannot be made use of in order to justify the deviations,&mdash;if any should indeed be
found. In order to ascertain this, we must examine more closely the quotation in
its relation to the original text of the passage, Matt. ii. 6:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058; &#914;&#951;&#952;&#955;&#949;&#8051;&#956;, &#947;&#8134; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#8182;&#962; &#7952;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#951; &#949;&#7990; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;

&#7992;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#8053;&#955;.</span> The first thing which demands our attention is
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#947;&#8134; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945;</span> for the Ephratah of the original.
The reason of this deviation is to be sought for in the circumstance, that the place
appears as Bethlehem Judah in 1 Sam. xvii. 12, where it is mentioned with a reference
to David. The deviation at the beginning has, accordingly, the same purpose
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 510]</span> as that at the close. As regards the grammatical
exposition of <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#947;&#8134; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945;</span>, it stands for: Bethlehem
situated in the land of Judah,&mdash;a short mode of expression which is common in geographical
and other similar designations, just as in the Old Testament also we find
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;</span>, for: Bethlehem situated in
the land of Judah. The assertion of many interpreters, that
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#947;&#8134;</span> has here the signification &quot;town,&quot; is as
objectionable as the attempt to change the text, made by <i>Fritzsche</i>, who advances
nothing on the whole verse that can stand examination. The Evangelist here as little
follows the LXX. as he does the Hebrew text. The former has here:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058; &#914;&#949;&#952;&#955;&#949;&#8051;&#956;, &#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#7960;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#952;&#8049;</span> (thus without
an article. <i>Cod. Vatic.</i>). <i>Fritzsche</i> thinks that
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> had been brought into the text from the
margin. But the translator evidently considered &quot;Ephratah&quot; to be the proper name
of Caleb&#39;s wife (1 Chron. ii. 19, 50, iv. 4), from whom others also, <i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Adrichomius</i> (compare <i>Bachiene</i> ii. 2, § 190), derived the name of the
place, and did nothing else than express more definitely, by the subjoined
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, the relation of dependence which, as
he supposed, was indicated by the Genitive. The apparent contradiction, that the
prophet calls Bethlehem small, whereas the Evangelist speaks of it as by no means
small, has already been so satisfactorily explained by ancient and modern interpreters
(compare, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Euthymius Zigabenus</i> <i>l. c.</i> p. 59: &quot;Although
in appearance thou art small, yet, truly, thou art by no means the least among the
principalities of the tribe of Judah;&quot; <i>Michaelis</i>: &quot;Micah, looking to the
outward condition, calls it small; Matthew, looking to the birth of the Messiah,
calls it by no means small, inasmuch as, by that birth, that town was in a wonderful
manner adorned and exalted&quot;), that we need not dwell upon it. We only remark, that
the supposition of <i>Paulus</i>, that the members of the Sanhedrim understood the
verse interrogatively&mdash;&quot;Art thou, perhaps, too small,&quot; etc.&mdash;receives no confirmation
from the passage in <i>Pirke Eliezer</i>, c. 3, which he quotes in favour of it,
but which he saw only in the Latin translation of <i>Wetzstein</i>; for, in the
original text, the verse is quoted in literal agreement with the Hebrew original;
compare <i>Eisenmenger</i>, i. p. 316. A comparison with the Chaldee, who with similar
liberty paraphrases, &quot;Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, shalt soon be numbered,&quot; clearly
shows that the deviation has arisen rather from an endeavour to express the sense
more <span class="pagenum">[Pg 511]</span> clearly and definitely. On such deviations,
<i>Calvin</i> strikingly remarks: &quot;Let the reader always attend to the purpose for
which the Evangelists quote Scripture passages, that they may not scrupulously insist
upon single words, but be satisfied with this,&mdash;that the Scriptures are never distorted
by them to a different sense.&quot;&mdash;Micah introduces Bethlehem in the person of its representative;
but this figure Matthew has dropped at the beginning. Instead of the Masculine
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;</span> he puts the Feminine
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#951;</span>; and, on the other hand, he renders
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;</span> by <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#957;
&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#953;</span>, which, in a way not to be mistaken, suggests this representation.
<i>Fritzsche</i> announces himself as the man who would heal this <i>f&#339;dum sol&#339;cismum</i>
which had not hitherto been remarked by any one. He proposes to read:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058; &#914;&#949;&#952;&#955;&#949;&#8050;&#956; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#8182;&#962; &#7952;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#951; &#949;&#7990; &#7952;&#957;
&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945;</span>,&mdash;and thou Bethlehem, by no means the smallest part of
the land of Judah, art,&quot; etc. But altogether apart from the arbitrary change of
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#947;&#8134; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945;</span>,&mdash;which certainly no one could ever
have been tempted to put for the more simple <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#945;&#962;</span>,&mdash;the
personification could even then not have been maintained, and the <i>f&#339;dus sol&#339;cismus</i>
would still remain. Even although the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#951;</span>
be understood in accordance with the &quot;<i>elegantissimus Græcorum usus</i>,&quot; Bethlehem
must, after all, be treated as a thing&mdash;as a town. Nor is the case much improved
by the assistance which <i>Fritzsche</i> immediately afterwards endeavours to give
to the text: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058; &#914;&#949;&#952;&#955;&#949;&#8050;&#956;, &#947;&#8134; &#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#8182;&#962; &#7952;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#951;
&#949;&#7990; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7992;&#959;&#8059;&#948;&#945;</span>, &quot;among the principal towns of the families in
Judea.&quot; Is there an instance in which <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#945;&#7985; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>
means the &quot;principal towns?&quot; Moreover, the relation of
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> to the subsequent
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7969;&#947;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, which requires the Masculine, has
been overlooked.&mdash;Micah personifies Bethlehem from the outset. Matthew first introduces
Bethlehem as a town, but afterwards passes to the personification by speaking of
the <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#8057;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>; instead of the tribes. For this
he had a special reason in the regard to the subsequent
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#7969;&#947;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>. Bethlehem, although outwardly small,
is, notwithstanding, when regarded from a higher point of view, even in the present
by no means small among the <i>leaders</i> of Judah, for, from it, in the future,
the great <i>leader</i> of Judah shall proceed. This relation, which is so evident,
must the rather be assumed, that in Micah also a contrast occurs which, as to the
sense, is altogether similar. It serves, at the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 512]</span>
same time, for a proof against the assumption that the Gospel of Matthew was originally
written in the Aramean language,&mdash;a view which is, generally, opposed also by the
free handling of the Old Testament text in the whole quotation. The inconsistency
in the use of the personification is, further, the more easy of explanation, since
it is altogether of an <i>ideal</i> character, and, substantially, person and town
are not distinguished.&mdash;The last words in Micah, &quot;And His goings forth,&quot; etc., have
been omitted by Matthew, because they were not needed for his purpose, which was
to show that, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament, the Messiah was
to be born at Bethlehem. On the other hand, the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>
of Micah is paraphrased by: <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#8150; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#8057;&#957;
&#956;&#959;&#965;, &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7992;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#8053;&#955;</span>. These words refer to 2 Sam. v. 2: &quot;And the Lord says to
thee, <i>Thou shalt feed My people Israel</i>, and thou shalt be a prince over Israel.&quot;
They point out the typical relation between the first David who was born at Bethlehem,
and the second David, the Messiah.</p>
<p class="normal">With respect to the relation betwixt prophecy and its fulfilment,
we must here still make a general remark. It is everywhere evident (compare the
remarks on Zech. ix. 9), that the fulfilment of the prophecies of the Old Testament
forms a secondary purpose of the events of the New Testament, but that in none of
the latter this fulfilment is the sole object. Every one, on the contrary, has its
significance apart from the prophecy; and it is by this significance that prophecy
and history are equally governed. This general remark is here also confirmed. The
birth of Christ at Bethlehem testified, in one respect, for the divine origin of
the prophecy of the Old Testament, and, in another, that Jesus is the Christ. But
its main object, altogether independent of this, was to represent, outwardly also,
the descent of Christ from David. This was recognised by the Jews even, at the time
of Christ, as appears from the addition <span lang="el" class="Greek">&#8005;&#960;&#959;&#965; &#7974;&#957; &#916;&#945;&#946;&#8055;&#948;</span>,
John vii. 42. Of the two seats of the Davidic family, viz., Bethlehem and Jerusalem,
the former is chosen, partly, because, from its external littleness, it was, generally,
very suitable for prefiguring the lowliness of the Messiah at the outset&mdash;a circumstance
which is expressly pointed out by the prophet himself&mdash;and partly, because it was
peculiar to the family of David during its obscurity; whilst Jerusalem, on the contrary,
belonged to their regal condition,&mdash;and the Messiah <span class="pagenum">[Pg 513]</span>
was to be born in the fallen tabernacle of David, to be a rod from the cut off stem
of Jesse, Is. xi. 1. That this reference also was in the view of the prophet, seems
to be evident from a comparison of iii. 12, and iv. 8, 9, 14. At all events he considered
the family of David as having altogether sunk at the time of the Messiah&#39;s appearing.
The very threatenings in chap. i.-iii. imply the destruction of the Davidic kingdom.
This meets us, very distinctly, in chap. iv.</p>
<hr class="W10">
<p class="normal"><a name="div3_513" href="#div3Ref_513">Ver. 2.</a> &quot;<i>Therefore
will He give them up until the time that she who is hearing hath brought forth;
and then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the sons of Israel.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">The description of what the Messiah is to bestow upon the Covenant-people
begins in this verse, and is carried on through the whole chapter. By
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;</span> the close connection of v. 1 with vi.
9-14 is indicated. <i>Michaelis</i> remarks: &quot;Because this is the counsel of God,
first to afflict Zion, on account of her sins, and, afterwards only, to restore
her through the Messiah to be born at Bethlehem.&quot; In chap. iv. 9-14, it is implied
that the giving up will not terminate <i>before</i> His birth; in v. 1, that it
will come to an end <i>with</i> His birth. The whole time described in iv. 9-14
is a time of affliction, of giving up Israel to the world&#39;s power in a threefold
form of its manifestation. In iv. 14, however, the affliction has reached its highest
point, and the lucid interval, mentioned in vers. 12, 13, has fully expired. It
is only when we look back to v. 1 alone, that the &quot;therefore&quot; with which our verse
opens is not explained, inasmuch as there it is said only, that with the Messiah
deliverance and salvation would come, but not that the affliction would continue
until He should come.&mdash;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;</span> is similarly used
in 2 Chron. xxx. 7: &quot;And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren who
trespassed against the Lord God of your fathers; therefore He gave them up to desolation
(<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;</span>), as you see.&quot; With respect to
the words, &quot;Until the time that she who is bearing hath brought forth,&quot; there is
an essential difference of opinion as to the explanation of the main point. One
class of interpreters&mdash;comprehending <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Cyril</i>, and by far
the greatest number of the ancient Christian expositors; and among the more recent,
<i>Rosenmüller</i>, <i>Ewald</i>, <i>Hitzig</i>, <i>Maurer</i>, and <i>Caspari</i>&mdash;understand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span> by &quot;her who is bearing,&quot; the mother of the
Messiah. Another class understands thereby the Congregation of Israel. The latter,
however, differ from each other as to the signification and import of the figure
of the birth. Some&mdash;<i>Abendana</i>, <i>Calvin</i>, and <i>Justi</i>&mdash;suppose the
<i>tertium comparationis</i> to be the joy following upon the pain. Others&mdash;<i>Theodoret</i>,
<i>Tarnovius</i> (&quot;until Israel, like a fruitful mother, has brought forth a numerous
progeny&quot;), <i>Vitringa</i> (in his <i>Commentary on Revel.</i> S. 534)&mdash;suppose it
to be the great increase. Let us first decide between these two modifications of
that view which refers the words to the Congregation of Israel. The former&mdash;the joy
following after the pain&mdash;appears to be inadmissible for this single reason, that
among the very numerous passages of the Old Testament where the image of a birth
is employed, there does not occur even one, in which the joy following after the
pain is made prominent, as is the case in the well-known passage in the New Testament.
On the contrary,<!--see 1854 ed.-->, in all the passages which come into consideration
on this point, it is rather the pain accompanying the birth which is considered.
Thus Mic. iv. 10; Is. xxvi. 17; Jer. iv. 31: &quot;For I hear a voice as of a woman in
travail, anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first-born child, the voice of
the daughter of Zion, she groaneth, spreadeth her hands: Woe to me, for my soul
is wearied, through them that kill;&quot; xxx. 6, xlix. 24; Hos. xiii. 13. To consider
the pain alone, however, as the <i>tertium comparationis</i>, is inadmissible, because,
in that case, we would obtain the absurd meaning: the suffering shall continue until
the suffering cometh. It is likewise impossible to understand the bringing forth
as the highest degree of affliction,&mdash;so that the sense would be: the Lord will give
them up until the distress reaches its highest point,&mdash;because this meaning could
apply only in the event of the lower degrees, the pains before the birth, being
also mentioned. They who hold and defend the second modification of this view, can
indeed refer to, and quote, a large number of parallel passages&mdash;almost all of them
from the second part of Isaiah&mdash;where this image occurs with a similar signification.
Thus, <i>e.g.</i>. Is. liv. 1: &quot;Shout for joy, O barren, thou that didst not bear;
break forth into shouting and exult, thou that didst not travail; for more numerous
are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife, saith the Lord;&quot;
xlix. 21, 22, lxvi. 7-9. But we must nevertheless prefer <span class="pagenum">[Pg
515]</span> to this explanation, that which refers the words to the mother of the
Messiah, for the following reasons. 1. If the words were to be referred to the Congregation
of Israel, we should expect the Article before <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492;</span>.
For the Congregation of Israel is substantially mentioned in what immediately precedes;
she is only a personification of those who are to be given up. 2. It is true that,
frequently, the personification is not consistently carried out; but the circumstance
that here, in the same sentence, the children of Israel are spoken of in the plural
(&quot;He will give <i>them</i> up&quot;), and that no trace of a personification is found
in what follows, but that, on the contrary, the children of Israel are mentioned
expressly, makes the pretended personification appear in rather an abrupt manner,
so that such an assumption would be admissible in a case of necessity only. 3. If
referred to the Congregation of Israel, the relation of the Messiah to that great
event, and epoch, is not intimated by a single word. Of Him ver. 1 speaks, and of
Him vers. 3-5. How then can it be that in ver. 2 there should all at once be a transition
to the general Messianic representation? 4. The suffix in
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;</span>, which refers to the Messiah, requires
that He should be indirectly mentioned in what precedes; and such is the case, only
when the <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492;</span> is she who is to bring forth
the Ruler announced in ver. 1. 5. It appears from the reference to Gen. xxxv., which
we have already pointed out and proved, that the prophet has in view one who is
to bring forth in Bethlehem. Bethlehem, which had in ancient times already become
remarkable by a birth, is in future to be ennobled by another birth, infinitely
more important. 6. The comparison of Is. vii. 14, where likewise the mother of the
Messiah is mentioned; compare the remarks on that passage. 7, and lastly&mdash;The evident
reference of &quot;Until the time that she who is bearing hath brought forth&quot; to &quot;From
thee shall come forth,&quot; suggests the mother of the Messiah. That she is designated
as &quot;she who brings forth,&quot; may be explained from the circumstance that she comes
into view here in a relation which is altogether one-sided, viz., only as regards
the one event of the birth of the Messiah.&mdash;Among the blessings which the Messiah
is to confer upon the Congregation of the Lord, there is first of all viewed the
fundamental blessing, the condition of all others, viz., the change which He is
to effect in the disposition of the Covenant-people. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</span>
It is this which, above and before everything else, needs to be changed, if Israel
is not any more to be given up; for Israel which is so only by name and in appearance,
is the legitimate prey of the world.&mdash;By the Brethren of the Messiah, the members
of the Old Covenant-people, His brethren according to the flesh, can alone be understood.
There is no Old Testament analogy for referring the expression to the Gentiles.
We are led to the reference to Israel by the connection with the first member of
the verse. The brethren are such as have become the Messiah&#39;s brethren by the circumstance
that He has been born of the Bethlehemitish woman &quot;who is to bring forth&quot; (<i>Caspari</i>).
We are led to it, <i>further</i>, by v. 1, according to which, the Messiah is to
be Ruler in Israel; and, <i>still further</i>, by the fundamental passage in Ps.
xxii. 23: &quot;I will declare Thy name unto my brethren,&quot; where, according to the address
in ver. 24, the brethren are all the descendants of Israel, among whom a great awakening
is to be produced.&mdash;The construction of <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1493;&#1489;</span>
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span> may be explained by the remark of
<i>Ewald</i>: &quot;<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span> stands in its primary local
signification with verbs also, when the thing moves to another thing, and remains
upon it.&quot; Of a material return the verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1493;&#1489;</span>
with <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;</span> is thus used in Prov. xxvi. 11, Eccles.
i. 6;&mdash;of a spiritual return, 2 Chron. xxx. 9: <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1513;&#1493;&#1489;&#1499;&#1501;
&#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span> &quot;when ye return to the Lord,&quot; properly, &quot;upon the Lord;&quot; and Mal.
iii. 24 (iv. 6): &quot;And he makes return the hearts of the fathers to the sons,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>,&quot;&mdash;which latter passage has a striking
resemblance to the one under review. In the latter signification
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1513;&#1493;&#1489;</span> must be taken here also.&mdash;By the &quot;sons
of Israel,&quot; here, as ordinarily, the whole of the Covenant-people are signified,
and that by its highest and holiest name. From this holy communion, the wicked&mdash;the
souls which, according to the expression of the Lord, are cut off from their people&mdash;are
separated and dissevered; compare my commentary on Ps. lxxiii. 1. The whole description
of the prevailing corruption, and especially vii. 1, 2, show us to what an extent
this separation existed at the time of the prophet. But, by the Saviour, this separation
is to be abolished, and the lost and wandering are to be brought back to the communion
of the church,&mdash;a work which, according to Rom. xi., will be perfected in the future
only.<sup class="ftnRef"><a name="ftnRef_516a" href="#ftn_516a">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p class="normal">Ver. 3. &quot;<i>And He stands and feeds in the strength of the Lord,
in the majesty of the name of the Lord His God; and they dwell, for now shall He
be great unto the ends of the earth.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">In this verse we are told what the Saviour shall do for awakened
and, thus, inwardly united Israel. &quot;He stands,&quot; has here not the signification of
&quot;He abides,&quot; but belongs merely to the graphic description of the habit of the shepherd;
compare Is. lxi. 5: &quot;And strangers stand and feed your flocks.&quot; The shepherd stands,
leaning upon his staff, and overlooks the flock. The connection of &quot;He feeds&quot; with
&quot;in the strength of the Lord,&quot; we cannot better express than <i>Calvin</i> has done
in the words: &quot;The word &#39;to feed&#39; expresses what Christ will be towards His people,
<i>i.e.</i>, towards the flock committed to Him. He does not exercise dominion in
the Church like a formidable tyrant who keeps down his subjects through terror,
but He is a Shepherd, and treats His sheep with all the gentleness which they can
desire. But, inasmuch as we are surrounded on all sides by enemies, the prophet
adds: &#39;He shall feed in the strength,&#39; etc.; <i>i.e.</i>, as much power as there
is in God, so much protection there will be in Christ, when it is necessary to defend
and protect His Church against enemies. We may learn, then, from this, that we may
expect as much of salvation from Christ as there is strength in God.&quot; The great
King is so closely united to God, that the whole fulness of divine power and majesty
belongs to Him. Such attributes are never given to any earthly king. Such a king
has, indeed, strength in the Lord, Is. xlv. 24; &quot;The Lord giveth strength to His
king, and exalteth the horn of His anointed,&quot; 1 Sam. ii. 10; but the whole strength
and majesty of God are not his possession. The passage <span class="pagenum">[Pg
518]</span> in Is. ix. 5 (6) is parallel,&mdash;where the Messiah is called
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;</span>, God-hero.&mdash;The &quot;name of God&quot; points
to the rich fulness in deeds, by which He has manifested the glory of His nature.
The Messiah will be the brightness and image of this His glory,&mdash;a glory which is
manifested by acts, and not a glory which is inactive and concealed. &quot;They dwell&quot;
forms a contrast to the disquietude and scattering, and we are, therefore, not at
liberty to supply &quot;safely&quot; before it. The last words are deprived of their meaning
and significance by explanations such as that of <i>Dathe</i>: &quot;His name shall attain
to great renown and celebrity.&quot; The ground of the present rest and safety of the
Congregation of the Lord rather is this,&mdash;that her Head has now extended His dominion
beyond the narrow limits of Palestine, over the whole earth; compare iv. 3.&mdash;2 Sam.
vii. 9 cannot here be compared, as there the <i>name</i> of the Lord is not spoken
of as it is here. That the &quot;being great&quot; here implies real dominion (<i>Maurer</i>:
<i>auctoritate et potentia valebit</i>), which alone can afford a pledge for the
dwelling in safety, is shown also by the fundamental passages Ps. ii. 8, lxxii.
8; compare Zech. ix. 10. In Luke i. 32 the passage before us is referred to. The
&quot;now&quot; does not by any means form a contrast with a former condition of the Messiah,
but with the former condition of the Congregation when she did not enjoy so powerful
a Ruler.</p>
<p class="normal">Ver. 4. &quot;<i>And this</i> (man) <i>is peace. When Asshur comes
into our land, and when he treads in our palaces, we raise against him seven shepherds,
and eight princes of men.</i> Ver. 5. <i>And they feed the land of Asshur with the
sword, and the land of Nimrod in its gates; and He protects from Asshur when he
comes into our land, and when he treads within our borders.</i>&quot;</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;And this man (He whose glory has just been described) is peace,&quot;&mdash;He
bestows that which we have so much needed, and longed for with so much anxiety in
these troublous times before His appearing. In a similar manner, and with reference
to the passage before us, it is said in Ephes. ii. 14:
<span lang="el" class="Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8057;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7969; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>, compare also Judges
vi. 24: &quot;And Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah-Peace,
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;</span>.&quot; Abandoning this explanation, which
is so natural, <i>Jonathan</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Rosenmüller</i>, and <i>Winer</i>
explain: &quot;And <i>there</i> will be peace to us,&quot;&mdash;an interpretation, however, which
is inadmissible even on philological grounds, <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1492;</span>
is nowhere used, either <span class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</span> as Adverb, loci =<!--1854 ed insert-->
&quot;here,&quot; or as Adverb, temp. = &quot;then.&quot; As regards the latter, such passages as Gen.
xxxi. 41&mdash;&quot;These are to me twenty years,&quot; instead of, &quot;twenty years have now elapsed&quot;&mdash;are,
of course, not at all to the purpose. But of such a kind are almost all the examples
quoted by <i>Nolde</i>. In Esther ii. 13 <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;</span>
is used. The verb <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1492;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;</span> in ver. 5 is likewise
in favour of understanding <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1494;&#1492;</span> personally;
compare also Zech. ix. 10: &quot;And He shall speak peace unto the nations.&quot;&mdash;There can
scarcely be any doubt that the words allude to the name of Solomon, and that the
Messiah is represented in them as the Antitype of Solomon. Upon this point there
is the less room for doubt, because even Solomon himself called the Messiah by his
name in the Song of Solomon; and in Is. ix. 5 (6) also, He is, with an evident allusion
to the name of Solomon, called the Prince of Peace.&mdash;All which follows after these
words, to the end of ver. 5, is only a particularizing expansion of the words: &quot;And
this (man) is peace.&quot; Interpreters have almost all agreed, that Asshur, the most
dangerous enemy of the Covenant-people at the time of the prophet, stands here as
a type of the enemies of the Covenant-people. Even <i>L. Baur</i> has translated:
&quot;And though another Asshur,&quot; etc., with a reference to the passage in <i>Virgil</i>
to which allusion had already been made by <i>Castalio</i>: &quot;<i>Alter erit tum Tiphys
et altera quæ vehat Argo delectos heroas.</i>&quot; That the prophet, however, was fully
conscious of his here using Asshur typically, appears from iv. 9, 10. For, according
to these verses, the first of the three catastrophes which preceded the birth of
the Messiah, proceeds from a new phase of the world&#39;s power, viz., from the Babylonian
empire, the rising of which implies the overthrow of the Assyrian. But the figurative
element in the representation goes still farther. From ver. 9 ff.&mdash;according to which
the Lord makes His people outwardly defenceless, before they become, in Christ,
the conquerors of the world&mdash;it is obvious that the spiritual struggle against the
world&#39;s power is here represented under the image of the outward struggle, carried
on with the sword. One might be tempted to confine the thought of the passage to
this: &quot;The Messiah affords to His people the same protection and security as would
a large number of brave princes with their hosts,&quot; inasmuch as the bestowal of these
was, under the Old Testament, the ordinary means by which the Lord delivered His
people. If, however, the spiritual character <span class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</span>
of the struggle only be maintained, there is no sufficient reason for considering
the seven and more shepherds and the princes as mere imagery, because, in the kingdom
of Christ also, the cause of the kingdom of God is carried on by human instruments,
whom He furnishes with His own strength. The words, &quot;This (man) is peace,&quot; and &quot;He
protects,&quot; in ver. 5, show indeed with sufficient distinctness, that, in the main,
Christ is the only Saviour,&mdash;the shepherds, His instruments only,&mdash;and their world-conquering
power, a derived one only. The apparent contradiction of the passage before us to
iv. 1-3, vii. 12&mdash;according to which the heathen nations shall, in the time of the
Messiah, spontaneously press towards the kingdom of God&mdash;is removed by the remark,
that we have here before us two different streams which may as well flow together
in prophecy as they do in history. The zeal with which the nations press towards
the kingdom is, in part, greatly called forth by the fact, that, in attacking the
kingdom of Christ, they have experienced its world-conquering power. The circumstance
that the words, &quot;This (man) is peace,&quot; stand at the beginning, proves that the main
idea is the security of the kingdom of God against all hostile attacks. For the
like reason it is, towards the end, resumed in the words, &quot;And He protects,&quot; etc.
But this affords no reason for saying, with <i>Caspari</i>: &quot;It forms part of the
defence, it is indeed its consummation, that the war is carried into Asshur.&quot; In
the first hemistich of ver. 5, it is intimated rather, that, in the time of the
Messiah, the positions of the world and of the people of God are changed,&mdash;that the
latter becomes world-conquering; and for this reason, every thought of their own
insecurity must so much the rather disappear. &quot;The land of Nimrod&quot; is, according
to Gen. x. 11, Asshur. The &quot;gates&quot; are those of the cities and fortresses, corresponding
with, &quot;When he treads in our palaces,&quot; in ver. 4. It weakens the sense to think
of the gates of the country, as such, <i>i.e.</i>, the borders. The attack, on the
contrary, is directed against, and strikes the real centre of the seat of the world&#39;s
power, just as, formerly, the stroke was always directed against Zion.</p>
<p class="normal">With regard to the remaining part of the chapter, we content ourselves
with a mere statement of the contents. The Congregation of the Lord shall, at that
time, not only be lovely and refreshing, ver. 6 (7), (this is the constant signification
of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 521]</span> image of the dew, compare Ps. cx. 3,
cxxxiii. 3, lxxii. 6; the relative pronoun <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;</span>
must be referred to the grass, mentioned immediately before; that which the dew
descending from heaven is to the grass, Israel will, in his heavenly mission, be
to the heathen world), but at the same time fearful and irresistible, vers. 7, 8
(8, 9); the latter of these qualities shall show itself not only as a curse in the
case of obstinate despisers, but also as a blessing in the case of those who are
estranged from the kingdom of God, through ignorance only. Resuming then the last
words of ver. 8 (9), &quot;All thine enemies shall be cut off,&quot; the prophet declares
that before this word shall be fulfilled, the destructive activity of the Lord will
be manifested in Israel itself. He will cut off by His judgments, and by the catastrophes
described in iv. 9-14, everything in which, in the present, they placed a carnal
confidence, everything by which they became externally strong and powerful (<i>Caspari</i>:
&quot;A cutting off, in the first instance, of all wherewith elsewhere enemies are commonly
cut off&quot;), and so likewise all idolatry, to which the Chaldean catastrophe already
put a violent end. It is only of such a termination by force, and not of a purely
inward effect of the &quot;gentle power of the Spirit then poured out upon them,&quot; that
the words here, as well as in reference to the horses, etc., permit us to think.
The two kinds of objects of false confidence are then, in conclusion, in ver. 13
(14) once more summed up,&mdash;when the cities, just as in ver. 10 (11), come into view
as fortresses only. If thus the path be cleared and prepared for the Lord, He will,
on behalf of His people, execute vengeance upon the heathen world.</p>

	<a name="ftn_516a" href="#ftnRef_516a">[1]</a></sup> After the example of <i>

	viz., the inhabitants of Judah, shall return from the captivity to Canaan, along
	with the sons of Israel, <i>i.e.</i>, the ten tribes.&quot; But the return from the
	captivity never appears in the prophets, as a work of the Messiah. It has here
	taken place long before His appearing: chap. iv. 10, iv. 11-14 supposes it to
	have taken place, and Zion to be in existence. The &quot;brethren of the Messiah&quot;

<h3><a name="div3_521" href="#div3Ref_521">CHAP. VI. VII.</a></h3>
<p class="normal">We shall now, in conclusion, give a survey of the third and closing
discourse of the prophet. After an introduction in vi. 1, 2, where the mountains
serve only to give greater solemnity to the scene (in the fundamental passages Deut.
xxxii. 1, and in Is. 1, 2,<!--should be Is. 1.2--> &quot;heaven and earth&quot; are mentioned
for the same purposes, inasmuch as they are the most venerable parts of creation;
&quot;contend <i>with</i> the mountains&quot; by taking them in and applying to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 522]</span> them as hearers), the prophet reminds the
people of the benefits which they have repaid with ingratitude, vers. 3-5. (In ver.
5 those facts also which served as a proof of its truth, are considered as part
of Balaam&#39;s answer.) He then, in vers. 6-8, shows the fallacy of the imagination
that they could satisfy the Lord by the observance of the mere outward forms of
worship, though such should be increased to the utmost, and performed in a manner
totally different from that in which it was in the present, and points out the spiritual
demands already made even by the law, and especially by Deut. x. 12, a compliance
with which could alone be pleasing to the Lord. From vi. 9-vii. 6, he shows to how
limited an extent these demands are complied with by the people,&mdash;how true and cordial
piety and justice have disappeared from the midst of them,&mdash;and how, therefore, the
threatenings of the law must, and shall be fulfilled upon them. The reproof and
threatening are then followed by the announcement of salvation, which refers indeed
to the Messianic times, but without any mention in it of the person of the Messiah,
the brightness of which meets us only in the main body of the prophecy. The main
thought here also is the entirely altered position of Israel in their relation to
the heathen world. &quot;A day is coming&quot;&mdash;so it is said in ver. 11&mdash;&quot;to build thy walls;
in that day shall the law be far removed.&quot; <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1490;&#1491;&#1512;</span>
is used especially of the walls and fences of vineyards; and under the image of
a vineyard, Israel appears as early as in the Song of Solomon. The wall around the
vineyard of Israel is the protection against the heathen world; Is. v. 5. The &quot;law&quot;
is, according to the context, in which the heathen oppressors are spoken of, that
which is imposed by them upon the people of God; Ps. xciv. 20. Ver. 12. &quot;<i>A day
it is when they shall come to thee from Asshur, and from the cities of Egypt, and
from Egypt to the river, and to sea from sea, and to mountain from mountain.</i>&quot;
It is not enough that the people of God are freed from the servitude of the world.
They shall become the objects of the longing of the nations, even the most powerful
and hostile. They become the magnet which attracts them; compare iv. 1, 2. From
among the heathen nations Asshur and Egypt are first specially mentioned, as the
two principal representatives of hostility against the kingdom of God in the present
and past, and, at the same time, as the two most powerful empires at the time of
the prophet<span class="pagenum"> [Pg 523]</span>&mdash;the latter quality being indicated
by the circumstance of Egypt&#39;s appearing under the name
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;</span>, &quot;fortress.&quot; But then, by the expressions
&quot;from sea to sea,&quot; &quot;from mountain to mountain,&quot; which are equivalent to &quot;from every
sea to every sea,&quot; etc., all barriers in general are completely removed; compare
in v. 3 (4) the words: &quot;He shall be great unto the ends of the earth.&quot; (The subject
in <span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;</span> can only be the inhabitants of these
countries themselves, not the Jews living there. If the latter had been intended,
a more distinct indication of it would have been required. The Masculine Suffix
<span lang="he" class="Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> &quot;to thee,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, not to Zion
but to Israel, is opposed to such a reference. This shows clearly that they who
come are different from Israel. In entire harmony with this prophecy is Is. xix.
18-25.) But, before such glory can be bestowed upon the people of God, the irrevocable
judgment must first have done its fearful work, ver. 13; compare the fundamental
passage Lev. xxvi. 33, and Is. i. 7. In ver. 14 the announcement of salvation takes
a new start. Vers. 18-20 form the sublime close, not only of the last discourse,
but also of the whole book, as is clearly indicated by the coincidence of the words,
&quot;Who is, O God, like unto Thee?&quot; ver. 18, with the mention of Micah&#39;s name in the
inscription. The name of the prophet, by which he is dedicated to the incomparable
God, has been confirmed by the contents of his prophecy. The New Testament parallel
passage is Rom. xi. 33-36: &quot;<i>Who is, O God, like unto Thee; pardoning iniquity,
and remitting transgression to the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His
anger for ever, because He delighteth in mercy.</i>&quot; &quot;Who is, O God, like unto Thee?&quot;
so the people once already sang after the redemption from Egypt. Thus it resounds
still more loudly in the view of the antitypal redemption, by which the fundamental
definition of the divine nature in Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7, and David&#39;s praise of divine
mercy in Ps. ciii., are fully realized. &quot;He will return and have compassion upon
us (according to the promise in Deut. xxx. 3), will overcome our iniquities (which,
like a cruel tyrant, like Pharaoh of old, subjected us to their power, Ps. xix.
14), and cast all their sins into the depth of the sea,&quot; as once He cast the proud
Egyptians, Exod. xv. 5-10. &quot;Thou wilt give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham,
as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.&quot;</p>

		<p class="continue">The writings of the early Christians are allowed on
		all hands to be of great importance, and to be invested with a peculiar
		interest; and regrets have often been expressed that it should be so difficult
		to know their contents. Many of them are mere fragments; and where complete
		works exist, the text is often so corrupt, and the style is so involved,
		that even a good classical scholar is repelled from their perusal. If the
		student of Latin and Greek meets with obstacles, the merely English reader
		is absolutely without the means of information. The greater part of the
		most important writings have never been translated; and those translations
		which have been made are, with the exception of the few executed in recent
		times, for the most part loose, inaccurate, and difficult to procure. To
		supply this great want is the object of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library.
		All the Christian writings antecedent to the Nicene Council have been put
		into the hands of competent translators. These will make it their first
		and principal aim to produce translations as faithful as possible, uncoloured
		by any bias, dogmatic or ecclesiastical. They will also endeavour, in brief
		notes, to place the English reader in the position of those acquainted with
		the original languages. They will indicate important variations in the text;
		they will give different translations of the same passage where more than
		one have been proposed; they will note the various meanings attributed to
		the words in ecclesiastical controversies; and when the ancient documents
		appear in widely different forms, the various forms will be presented. At
		the same time, they will strive to combine with this strict accuracy and
		faithfulness as much elegance as may be consistent with the main aim. Short
		biographical <span class="pagenum">[Pg 526]</span> and explanatory notices
		will be prefixed to each translation; and in every case where there is variety
		of opinion, the writer will abstain from expressing his own sentiments,
		and confine himself simply to an impartial statement of the opinions of
		the most noteworthy critics on the point.</p>

		<p class="normal">It is intended to include in the Series every Christian

		<p class="normal">The Publishers&#39; arrangements are such, that the publication,

		will be required to take the work more rapidly than four Volumes annually,
		it is highly probable that the whole may be finished at a much earlier period,
		for the convenience of those who may desire to have their sets completed.
		The Volumes will be handsomely bound in cloth, with red edges; but Subscribers
		may have them with uncut edges, by intimating their wish with their order.</p>
		<p class="normal">They will be greatly obliged by intending Subscribers
		filling up the accompanying Slip, and returning it to them speedily, as

		<h3>THE COMPARATIVE GEOGRAPHY</h3>
		<h5>OF</h5>
		<h3>PALESTINE</h3>
		<h5>AND THE</h5>
		<h3>SINAITIC PENINSULA.</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>By CARL RITTER,</h3>
		<h5>PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN.</h5>
		<br>
		<h4>Translated and Adapted to the use of Biblical Students, by</h4>
		<h3>WILLIAM L. GAGE.</h3>
		<hr class="W20">
		<p class="continue"><span class="sc">Carl Ritter</span>, the late Professor
		of Geography in the University of Berlin, is known by name to many who are
		comparatively uninformed respecting the extent and value of his labours.
		In portraying the connection of geography with the physical sciences, Alexander
		von Humboldt had no superior; while in establishing the relation between
		geography and history, <span class="sc">Carl Ritter</span> was as unquestionably
		pre-eminent. A chair was created for him in the Berlin University as early
		as 1820. He lived to occupy it for forty years, and to confer no less honour
		upon the city where he resided, and the institution in which he taught,
		than upon his own name. And though but slight glimpses of his career have
		been caught by the people of Great Britain, yet such references to him as
		that in the Preface to Robinson&#39;s <i>Biblical Researches</i>, and works
		of a similar character, will convince the readers of this country that whatever
		comes from his pen must have great and permanent value.</p>
		<p class="normal">Professor <span class="sc">Ritter&#39;s</span> main work relates
		to Asia, and includes therefore all of that territory which is known as
		the Holy Land. To this,&mdash;including the Lebanon district, Palestine proper,
		the country east of the Jordan, and the Sinaitic Peninsula,&mdash;<span class="sc">Ritter</span>
		devotes a space equal to 6000 pages of the size employed in Messrs Clark&#39;s
		publications. To translate a mass so voluminous as this would be evidently
		impracticable; and yet the immense erudition and power of graphic description
		of Professor <span class="sc">Ritter</span>, conjoined with the fact that
		he brought to the study of the Holy Land, not the unbelief of a rationalist,
		but living faith of a genuine Christian, has convinced the publishers that
		a portion of his great work would be a welcome offering to all students
		of Biblical Geography.</p>
		<p class="normal">Messrs Clark accordingly now publish a translation executed
		by <span class="sc">Rev. William L. Gage</span>, a pupil and friend of the
		lamented <span class="sc">Ritter</span>, comprising that portion of the
		volumes relating to the Holy Land, which, in his judgment as editor, shall
		be the most acceptable addition to our biblical literature. The work is
		comprised in four octavo volumes. <span class="sc">Mr GAGE</span> has been
		engaged for several years in the study and interpretation of Professor
		<span class="sc">Ritter&#39;s</span> writings, and has enjoyed the active co-operation
		of many of the most eminent living geographers.</p>
		<p class="normal">The main object which has been held in view in condensing
		and in selecting from the original, is to prepare the work for the use of
		biblical students. Everything illustrating the Bible bas been considered
		of prime importance, and everything has been retained, needful to maintain
		the unity of the work. Notes are added, indicative of discoveries made since
		<span class="sc">Ritter</span> wrote, and the object has never been lost
		from sight&mdash;to make the work worthy of taking the same place in English that
		it has already done in German literature.</p>
